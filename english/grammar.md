--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Rules
-----------

1. Every word is read as it is written. No letter is silent. Only the lower-case letters are necessary.
2. The stress accent is on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns are undefined by number and gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
4. When adjective is before the noun, it is a modifier. When it follows the noun, it is an adjectival verb.
    - ex. **bon pan** = Good bread. **pan bon** = Bread (is) good.
5. Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them. The main word stands at the end.
    - ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox
6. Sentences with transitive verbs have subject-verb-object word order. Most active verbs end in **-a**.
    - ex. **mi penta mesa.** = I paint tables.
7. Sentence with passive meaning has only subject and verb. Most passive verbs end in **-u**.
    - ex. **meza pentu.** = Table is painted.
8. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the following verb. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.
    - ex. **mi cing ti dona pesa.** = I ask you to give money.
9. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **mi kia ti loga pandunia?** → **kia ti loga pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **mi cing ti loga tez.** →  **cing loga tez.** = Please speak louder.




Parts of speech
---------------

All words are invariable in Pandunia. There is no inflexion of any kind. That's why the parts of speech depend on the meaning of words, not on the form.

The parts of speech in Pandunia are:

1. The noun names a thing, a person, an abstract concept or a proper name, ex. stone, table, robot, cat, human, city, london.
2. The modifier is a word that adds some quality to the thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.
3. The numeral is a word that tells the number or amount of things.
4. The verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.
5. The particle is a structural or an abstract word, ex. yes, no, but, if.



Nouns
-----

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batu** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones
> **meza** - a table, tables, the table or the tables
> **sui** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the word **sol** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and our only moon.

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **sol guang** - sun light  
> **luna guang** - moon light  
> **luna batu** - moon stone

When an adjective or a verb is converted into a noun, it often ends in **-e**.

> **posta** - to mail (to send by mail)
> **poste** - mail
> **nov** - new
> **nove** - new


Modifiers
---------

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality for another word. In Pandunia modifiers come before the noun that they modify.

> **day batu** - big stone
> **cung batu** - heavy stone  
> **day meza** - bit table  
> **gau meza** - high table

When a modifier follows a noun phrase, it becomes a stative verb.

> **batu day.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza gau.** - The table is high.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

> **day meza gau.** - The big table is high.



Numerals
--------

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about. For example, the word **sol** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un tara** - one star  
> **du tara** - two stars  
> **san tara** - three stars  
> **xau tara** - few stars  

Ordinal numerals come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen du** - the second part (part two)
> **fen san** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **san**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **set**
- 8 **bat**
- 9 **noy**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another – exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un du**
- 13 **un san**
- 20 **du nul**
- 21 **du un**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **du nul nul** or **du hon**


Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    


Pronouns
--------

### Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**mi** - I, me  
**ti** - you  
**ta** - he, she, it  
**mimen** - we  
**timen** - you all  
**tamen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.


### Demonstrative pronouns

**ni** - this, these  
**tu** - that, those  
**el** - the one(s)

The demonstrative pronouns work like modifiers.

> **ni batu.** - This stone
> **ni ye batu.** - This is a stone.
> **ni batu cung.** - This stone is heavy.


### Interrogative pronoun

**Ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of English words _who, what_ and _which_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?
> **ke ting?** - What? (Which thing?)
> **ke ren?** - Who? (Which person?)
> **ke sabab?** - Why? (Which reason?)
> **ke zam?** - When? (What time?)


### Relative pronoun

**Jo**, the relative pronoun, corresponds to English words _which, that, who_ and _whom_.

> **mi leva batu, jo cung.** - I lift a stone, which is heavy.
> **ta adam, jo mi vida.** - He is the man whom I saw.
> **mimen suka ren, jo suka mimen.** - We like people who like us.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Predicate of state
------------------

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a ponoun and the predicate is an adjective.

**mi bon.** - I am good.  
**sara bon.** - Sara is good.  
**batu cung.** - Stone is heavy.

Likewise, it's possible that the subject is a pronoun and the predicate is a noun.

> **ta sara.** - She is Sara.
> **ta batu.** - It is a stone.

But when two similar words (that belong to the same part of speech) are put together, it is necessary to separate them. Particle **ye** (yes) does it.

> **ta ye mi.** - It is me.
> **tu ye batu.** - That is a stone.
> **batu ye ting.** - Stone is a thing.
> **jovan ye sundar.** - Young is beautiful.

To deny something, use the word **no** instead of **ye**.

> **mi no ti.** - I'm not you.
> **batu no hewan.** Stone is not an animal.
> **jovan no sundar.** - Young is not beautiful.


Predicate of action
-------------------

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb (i.e. an action-word). In Pandunia, verbs are easy to identify because most of them end in **-a** or **-u**.

Ending **-a** is used in the subject–verb–object word order (SVO), which is the normal word order also in English and in many other languages, including French, Spanish, Chinese and Modern Arabic.

> **mi kana pan.** - I eat bread.
> **mi vida ti.** - I see you.

Ending **-u** is used in the subject–object–verb word order (SOV). SOV is the normal word order in many languages, including Japanese, Korean, Turkish and the languages of India.

> **mi pan kanu.** - I eat bread. (Word-for-word: _I bread eat._)
> **mi ti vidu.** - I see you. (Word-for-word: _I you see._)

The passive voice is formed by deleting the agent subject from the SOV type, leaving only OV.

> **pan kanu.** - Bread is eaten.



Serial verbs
------------

All action-words that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be 2, 3 or even more action-words in series.

1. **mi go jia.** - I go home.  
2. **mi ken go jia.** - I can go home.  
3. **mi vol ken go jia.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I want can go home_!)


Pivot structure
---------------

When the predicate has an object, the object can begin a new predicate. This is called the _pivot structure_.

> **mi vol ti kana sabzi.** - I want (that) you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi vol** has **ti** as its object. At the same time, **ti** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **kana sabzi**. So **ti** is _the pivot_ of the sentence.


Pronoun dropping
----------------

In certain type of expressions the pronouns gets dropped because of brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

> **mi cing ti lay.** - I ask you to come.  
> **cing lay!** - Please come! (Literally: _Request come!_)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Affirmation and negation
------------------------

Particle **ye** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **ye** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it. In other words **ye** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "to be not" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **ye** is not necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

> **mi ye ren.** - I am a person.  
> **ta ye un nov meza.** - It is a new table.

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

> **mi no ren.** - I'm not a person.  
> **ta no nov meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **mi vida ti.** - I see you.  
> **mi no vida ti.** - I don't see you.  
> **mi vida no ti ama tamen.** - I see, not you, but them.

These particles also answer questions.

> **kia ti vida mi?** - Do you see me.  
> **ye. (mi vida ti.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
> **no. (mi no vida ti.)** - No. (I don't see you.)



Modifier particles
------------------

There are two particles that change a word or phrase into a modifier, **ge** and **de**. They have the same function but the word order is different. **Ge** connects the modifying word to the modified word, and **de** connects the modified word to the modifying word, in precisely the said order.

When pronouns are turned into modifiers, they become _possessive pronouns_. There are two ways to build them in Pandunia.

| With _ge_                        | With _de_                                |
|:---------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| **mi ge jia** - my home          | **jia de mi** - the home of mine         |
| **ti ge jia** - your home        | **jia de ti** - the home of yours        |
| **ta ge jia** - his/her/its home | **jia de ta** - the home of his/hers/its |
| **mimen ge jia** - our home      | **jia de mimen** - the home of ours      |
| **timen ge jia** - your home     | **jia de timen** - the home of you all   |
| **tamen ge jia** - their home    | **jia de tamen** - the home of theirs    |


A modifier particle changes any kind of phrase into an equivalent of a quality-word. So also nouns and verbs can be changed into modifiers.

> **maria ge mama** - Maria's mother  
> **batu ge cung** - stone's weight  
> **kana ge zam** - the moment of eating



Prepositions
------------

Pandunia has three prepositions of place.

1. **na** - location (in general): at, in, on
2. **ze** - origin: from, since
3. **do** - destination: to, till, until

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **mi lay jia.** - I come home.
> **ti seda kursi.** - You sit (on) the chair.
> **ta lala sofa.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.
> **fix nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the water.
> **janger marxa dau.** - Warriors march (on) the road.

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **mi na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.
> **mi sona na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.
> **mi sona ze xam do suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.
> **mi safara ze london do paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they refer to time.

> **mi denga ze ti toka.** - I have waited since you left.
> **mi denga do ti lay jia.** - I wait until you come home.
> **mi denga na ti sona.** - I wait while you sleep.

More precise expressions of place are expressed with _a preposition + place word + **de**_.

> **na dur de** - for the time/duration of
> **mi denga na dur de ti sona.** - I wait for the time when you sleep.
> **na lok de** - at the place of
> **mi denga na lok de ti toka.** - I wait at the place where you left.
> **na xia de** - under, below
> **un kuta lala na xia de meza.** - A dog lies under the table.
> **na men de** - on the surface of
> **un mau lala na men de meza.** - A cat lies on the table.

Similar meaning can be expressed also with compound words.

> **un mau lala na meza men.** - A dog lies at the tabletop.

In addition, a preposition can be followed immediately by a verb.

> **dura** - to last, to take time
> **mi denga na dura ti sona.** - _I wait during you sleep._



Tense, Aspect and Mood
----------------------

### Mood

Mood particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener. Mood particles are commonly used in many languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a mood particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence, when the mood particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

> **ta kana bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ta kana plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ta plus kana bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ta kana bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Possibly a more foreign example is the question particle **ka**. It works just like **plus**, only the meaning is different. So **ka** puts the subsequent word under question, or the entire sentence.

> **ti kana bir ka?** - Do you drink beer?  
> **ti kana ka bir?** - _Is is beer_ that you drink?  
> **ti ka kana bir?** - _Is it drinking_ that you do to the beer?  
> **ka ti kana bir?** - _Is it you_ who drinks beer?


Note! Also adjectives can modify the subsequent word or the entire sentence.

> **mi bon kitaba buk.** - I write well books.
> **mi kitaba bon buk.** - I write good books.
> **mi kitaba buk bon.** - I write books well.

However, mood particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.


### Tense

In Pandunia, tense is expressed with time words and time phrases. The general time words are **gon** (past), **nun** (present) and **futur** (future). They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **mi hav mau gon.** - I had cats in the past.
> **ama mi no hav mau nun.** - But I don't have cats now.
> **munkin mi hav mau futur.** - Maybe I have cats in the future.

Verbs are not conjugated! So the verb **hav** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.


<!-- There are also countless of other ways to express time. -->

### Sentence Word Orders

In theory, there are six possible word orders for the transitive sentence. In practice, all of them are possible in Pandunia. They are made possible by the two verb endings, which decide the order of the other constituents (subject and object).

    1. With the verb ending in -a
        - object–subject–verb (OSV) : pan mi kana.
        - subject–verb–object (SVO) :     mi kana pan.
        - verb–object–subject (VOS) :        kana pan mi.
    2. With the verb ending in -u
        - subject-object-verb (SOV) : mi pan kanu.
        - object-verb-subject (OVS) :    pan kanu mi.
        - verb-subject-object (VSO) :        kanu mi pan.

The constituent, which is further away from the verb, can be left out. So for example **pan mi kana** (OSV) can be truncated to **mi kana** (SV). Likewise **mi pan kanu** (SOV) can be truncated to **pan kanu** (OV).

The typical word orders in everyday Pandunia are SVO, SOV and OSV, which occurs frequently in dependant clauses like **mi vida ren, jo ti suka.** (I saw the person _whom you like_.) The other word orders can be heard in poetry and in other forms of literary language.
