Grammar of Pandunia
====================

Introduction
------------

Pandunia is a constructed language that is built for a very special purpose:
it is to be a language of world-wide communication. This ambitious goal sets
special requirements for the language. It has to be learnable by all people
– regardless of which language or languages they happen to know before –
and learnable to confident mastery!

Grammatical categories and markings, which people learn in their mother tongue
and take for granted ever since, are by no means universal. Therefore the 
grammar of an international language is the best when it is reduced into a
minimum. This points to an isolating grammar, which is free from inflection
and morphology.

Pandunia, as an isolating language, has the following grammatical properties:

1. It uses word order to mark the relations in a sentence.
2. It relies almost exclusively on full words, very seldom on vague _particles_
   and never on affixes.
3. It doesn't require the speaker to say more than what the context requires.
   (Whereas many other languages require the speaker to specify gender, tense, mood
   and other factors always!)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Word types
==========

In Pandunia the main word types (which are also called parts of speech) are
content words and function words. The content words are further divided into
thing-words, action-words, quality-words and quantity-words.

Note! This grammar avoids using categories like the noun, the verb and the
adjective, because they could bring forward wrong associations in the mind of
the reader. Pandunia works in a different way than English. So it is best to
approach it with an open mind.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Content words
=============

Content words are words that refer to some thing, action or quality.
They are divided into four categories as follows.

1. Thing-words: **sabzi** vegetable, **mau** cat, **ren** person,
   **meza** table, **lume** light, **tara** star, **sole** sun, **sama** sky.
2. Action-words: **yem** eating, **loga** speaking, **vide** seeing,
   **sabe** knowing, **vola** wanting.
3. Quality-words: **bon** good, **nov** new, **sundar** beautiful,
   **kuai** fast, **sana** healthy.
4. Quantity-words: **un** one, **du** two, **san** three, 
   **poli** many, **xau** few.

Thing-words refer to a class of things. They don't contain information
about the quantity. In other words, there aren't separate singular and plural
forms.
For example the word **batu** can refer to any number of stones, and likewise
**tara** can refer to one or more stars.

Sometimes the context tells how many objects are spoken about. In the normal
context on Earth, **sama** refers to the only sky and **sole** refers to the
only sun that there is.

Quantity can be expressed with quantity-words. They are put before the word
or phrase that they qualify.

**un tara** - one star  
**du tara** - two stars  
**san tara** - three stars  
**xau tara** - few stars  
**poli tara** - many stars

Thing-words can be put together with each other.

**sole lume** - sun light  
**tara lume** - star light  
**tara sama** - star sky

Also quality-words can be put together with thing-words.

**un nov meza** - one new table  
**du sana ren** - two healthy persons  
**poli sundar tara** - many beautiful stars


Pronouns
--------

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**mi** - I, me  
**ti** - you  
**ta** - he, she, it  
**mimen** - we  
**timen** - you all  
**tamen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**ce** - who, what or which?  
**ki** - (the one) that (relative pronoun)  
**ni** - this, these  
**na** - that, those  
**el** - the one(s)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Predicates
==========


Predicate of state
------------------

When the predicate begins with a thing-word, a quality-word or a quantity-word, it becomes a predicate of identity. It is translated to English with "to be".

**mi ren.** - I am a person. (Literally: _I person._)  
**mi nov.** - I am new. (Lit. _I new._)  
**ta nov meza.** - It is a new table. (Lit. _It new table._)  
**tamen du sundar tara.** - They are two beautiful stars.

When a quality-word follows a thing-word, they make a sentence that expresses state.

**un meza nov.** - One table is new.
**tara sundar.** - Stars are beautiful.

The predicate can include an action-word, but it is an inactive part of the phrase.

**mi un yem sabzi ren.** - I am a vegetarian.  
**ta un yem de meza.** - It is a dinner table.


Predicate of action
-------------------

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is an action-word.

**mi yem.** - I eat.  
**ti vide.** - You see.

The predicate can have an object, which is simply the word that follows the action-word.

**mi yem sabzi.** - I eat vegetables.  
**ti vide tara.** - You see stars.

So the basic sentence word order is subject-predicate-object.

Naturally pronouns can also function as objects of the predicate.

**mi vide ti.** - I see you  
**tamen vola loga ta.** - They want to speak it.


Action-words in series
----------------------

All action-words that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be 2, 3 or even more action-words in series.

1. **mi vide tara.** - I see the stars.  
2. **mi vola vide tara.** - I want to see the stars.  
3. **mi vola ken vide tara.** - I want to be able to see the stars.


Pivot structure
---------------

When the predicate has an object, the object can begin a new predicate. This is called the _pivot structure_.

**mi vola ti yem sabzi.** - I want you to eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi vola** has **ti** as its object. At the same time, **ti** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **yem sabzi**. So **ti** is _the pivot_ of the sentence.

The pivot structure is very useful for expressing the speaker's point of view to what others do.

**mi vola ti lai.** - I want you to come.  
**mi xaka tamen yem tot banana.** - I suspect they ate all bananas.  
**mi vide ta na dukan.** - I saw him in the shop.

The reflexive pronoun can also function as the pivot.

**mi vola se sundar.** - I want (myself) to be beautiful.

Also a thing-word can function as the pivot with the help of **se**.

**mi vide jovan ren na dukan.** - I see young people in the shop.


Pronoun dropping
----------------

In certain type of expressions the pronouns gets dropped because of brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

**mi cing ti lai.** - I ask you to come.  
**cing lai!** - Please come! (Literally: _Request come!_)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Particles
=========


Affirmation and negation
------------------------

Particle **ye** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **ye** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it. In other words **ye** means "to be" or "there is" and **no** means "to be not" or "there is not".

Expressions are affirmative by default, so the word **ye** is not necessary. However it is especially convenient in expressions of state.

**mi ye ren.** - I am a person.  
**ta ye un nov meza.** - It is a new table.

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

**mi no ren.** - I'm not a person.  
**ta no un nov meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

**mi vide ti.** - I see you.  
**mi no vide ti.** - I don't see you.  
**mi vide no ti ama tamen.** - I see, not you, but them.

These particles also answer questions.

**kia ti vide mi?** - Do you see me.  
**ye. (mi vide ti.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
**no. (mi no vide ti.)** - No. (I don't see you.)



Qualifier particle: de
----------------------

The particle **de** changes any kind of phrase into a quality-phrase.

The personal pronouns are changed into possessive pronouns.

**mi de** my  
**ti de** your  
**ta de** his, her or its  
**mimen de** our  
**timen de** your  
**tamen de** their

Here's how it works in sentences.

**mi de mama se sundar.** - My mother is beautiful.  
**mi suka ti de dom** - I like your house.

Also content words are changed into possessives.

**maria de mama** - Maria's mother  
**loga de tema** - the topic of the speech  
**jovan de dom** - house of the young

Even a predicate can be qualified with the help of **de**.

**ta loga pandunia.** - He speaks Pandunia.  
**ta sundar de loga pandunia.** - He beautifully speaks Pandunia.

Also thing-words can qualify a predicate.

**ta bate ding.** - He hits nails.  
**ta hamar de bate ding.** - He "hammerly" hits nails.


Time-words
----------

Time-words express a point in time or an aspect (i.e. a point of view) to the time when something happened. Their function is similar to function of English words like _tomorrow, now_ and _already_.

**suba** - (in the) morning  
**din** - (at) daytime  
**xam** - (in the) evening  
**noce** - (in the) night  
**yer** - yesterday  
**kal** - tomorrow  
**hai** - still  
**la** - already  
**gang** - just, recently  
**sun** - soon

The place of the particle doesn't matter. It can be placed freely to express different emphasis.

**hai mi yem.** - Still I eat.  
**mi hai yem.** - I still eat.  
**mi yem hai.** - I eat still.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Compound words

Compound words are an effective way to grow your vocabulary. In Pandunia compound words always consist of whole words. There aren't any special prefixes or suffixes, such as -er and -al are in English words like _maker_ and _natural_.

**kan** means a place or a workshop.
