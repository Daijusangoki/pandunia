Quick Start

Introduction
------------

This is a short and simple guide to Pandunia, a constructed world language.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn. Compared with other languages that you have probably studied in the past, it has a relatively simple vocabulary, a simple grammar, a simple spelling and simple sounds.

One thing to keep in mind as you learn Pandunia is that it is not a strict, rule-oriented language where there is a "right way" and a "wrong way" to say things. The important thing is to make yourself understood. Consequently, much of the language involves words that have meaning, like "book" or "eat", and very little involves purely grammatical ideas (like singular vs. plural and tenses).


Pronunciation
-------------

The alphabet of Pandunia is the same as in English minus the letter Q. It is acceptable to use only lower-case letters. Upper-case letters can be used optionally to begin sentences and proper names.

The vowels **A E I O U** are pronounced approximately as follows: **A** as in _father_, **E** as in _get_, **I** as in marine, **O** as in _boy_, and **U** as in _rule_. They are pure vowels, i.e. they have the same quality from the beginning to the end.

Diphthongs are sounds that glide from one vowel sound to another. So for example **EI** begins with **E** sound and ends in **I** sound, much like the _ei_ in _eight_ in English.

Most consonants are pronounced as in English. **G** is always hard, **H** is never silent, **S** is always sharp, **X** is pronounced like _sh_ in _ship_, **C** is pronounced like _ch_ in _chip_ or _c_ in _cello_!

Semivowels **Y** and **W** are used only in the beginning of a syllable.

All words of more than one syllable are stressed on the last syllable. This is a simple principle but it will not be easy for all speakers. Just do your best and listen to others keenly!



One-word sentences
------------------

When a baby learns to speak, at first he or she says only single words before he or she learns to make two- or three-word sentences. Also you have to start from the beginning when you learn a new language. There is no shame in that! But you will learn much faster than a baby because you already have the ability of speaking languages.

Pandunia is easy to begin. One-word sentences are a normal part of the language. In addition, words never change in Pandunia, so you don't have to worry about remembering things like feminine and masculine gender, singular and plural forms, definite and indefinite forms or even verb conjugation.

So at first you can make simple observations with just words.

> **meza.** - A table.  
> **kursi.** - A chair.  
> **hima.** - Snow. (It's snowing!)

Describing Being
----------------

The simplest sentences consist of a subject and a one-word desciption, which can be a noun or an adjective.

> **ta sara.** - She is Sara.  
> **ta kawai.** - She is cute.  
> **ta batu.** - It's a stone.  
> **batu cung.** - The stone is heavy.

This simple structure works for a pronoun and a noun, and for a noun and an adjective. But when you combine two words of the same type, you need to add **se** in the middle.

> **mi se ti.** - I am you.  
> **batu se ting.** - The stone is a thing.  
> **jovan se sundar.** - Young is beautiful.

To say the opposite, you add **no** in the middle.

> **mi no ti.** - I'm not you.  
> **ta no sara.** - She is not Sara.  
> **ta no kawai.** - She is not cute.  
> **ta no batu.** - It's not a stone.  
> **batu no cung.** - The stone is not heavy.


Modifying Nouns
---------------

You can modify nouns in a sentence, using adjectives, number words and other modifiers that stand before the noun.

> **ta cung batu.** - It is a heavy stone.  
> **ni du cung batu.** - These two heavy stones.

Ordinal numerals are put after the noun.

> **fen un** - the first part; part one  
> **fen du** - the second part; part two  
> **fen san** - the third part; part three


Describing Actions
------------------

In active sentences, the most typical word order is subject–verb–object (SOV).

> **mi yem pingo.** - I eat apple(s).

Note: There is no conjugation of verbs. **Yem** can mean _eats_, _ate_ and _will eat_.

There is also alternative word order, which is subject–object–verb (SVO). It is used mostly in short sentences.

> **mi pingo yem.** - _I apple(s) eat._

SOV and SVO are the two most common word orders by far in the languages of the world. SOV is used by languages like Hindi-Urdu, Tamil, Turkish, Japanese and Korean. SVO is used by English, Mandarin Chinese and Indonesian among others.

In passive sentences, the subject is the undergoer of the action and there is no object.

> **pingo yem.** - Apples are eaten.  
> **batu no yem.** - Stones are not eaten.


Verbs in Series
---------------

Two active verb phrases can be put together in series. In the serial verb structure, the verbs share the same subject.

> **mi ken go dom.** - I can go home.  
> **mi yau go dom.** - I need to go home. (I should come home.)

Passive and active verb phrases can be put together too.

> **mi mus go dom.** - I must go home. (I am forced to go home.)  
> **mi les go dom.** - I may go home. (I am allowed to go home.)


Pivot Structure
---------------

In the pivot structure, the object of the first verb functions as the subject of the second verb. It's not as difficult  as it sounds. Sometimes a similar structure is used in English too.

> **ta cing mi go dom.** - He asks me to go home.  
> **ta les mi go dom.** - He lets me go home.  
> **ta mus mi go dom.** - He forces me to go home.

Unimportant pronouns can be left out.

> **mi cing ti go dom.** - I ask you to go home.  
> **cing go dom.** - Please go home.


Asking Questions
----------------

**Ke** is the general question word. It corresponds to _what, who_ and _which_ in English.

> **ti ke?** - Who are you?  
> **ke batu se cung?** - Which stone is heavy?  
> **ke sabab?** - Why? (What reason?)  
> **ke moment?** - When? (What moment?)


Modal Particles
---------------

Modal particles are used for expressing the speaker's attitude to what he or she is saying. Modal particle affects the word that is immediately after it. If the modal particle is the last word of the sentence, it affects the entire sentence.

The word **sol** _(only, just)_ is a good example because it works almost exactly like in English.

> **ta yem vin sol.** - He drinks wine, only.  
> **ta yem sol vin.** - He drinks _only wine_. (He doesn't drink anything else.)  
> **ta sol yem vin.** - He _only drinks_ wine. (He doesn't do anything else.)  
> **sol ta yem vin.** - _Only he_ drinks wine. (Nobody else does it.)

A more exotic example is the question particle **ma**. Structurally it works exactly like **sol**, but it has a different meaning. **Ma** questions the next word or, when it is the last word, the entire sentence.

> **ti yem vin ka?** - Do you drink wine?  
> **ti yem ka vin?** - Is it wine that you drink?  
> **ti ka yem vin?** - Do you _drink_ wine?  
> **ka ti yem vin?** - Is it you who drinks wine?

Other common modal particles are **ham** (also, too), **hata** (even, implies extreme case), **ya** (indeed, as you know), **ne** (asking for affirmation or reaction), **ba** (polite suggestion), **la** (emphasizing speaker's own opinion).

Note: To say _either A or B_, say **sol A sol B**. To say _both A and B_, say **ham A ham B**.
