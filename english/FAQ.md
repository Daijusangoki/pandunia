#### Why the mascot of Pandunia is a duck-billed platypus?

Platypus is an egg-laying, duck-billed, beaver-tailed, otter-footed mammal that lives in eastern Australia. It is an unusual creature. That's why the platypus is a fitting mascot for Pandunia, which is also an unusual mix, a mix of words and grammar from East and West, from North and South.

Pandunia doesn't fit into any of the traditional types of languages. Also in that regard it is similar to the platypus, which is of its own type.

#### I want to change something in Pandunia. What should I do?

If your change is a small thing, you should try it in practice with other people and see how it works. If it really is a good change, other people will accept it and use it.

Creating offshoot languages is very common in the auxiliary language community. The case of Esperanto is famous. Offshoots of Esperanto are counted in the hundreds but most people haven't even heard of them. Esperanto is still the most popular language of its kind.

It is better to have one big language with several dialects than many competing languages.

#### How does Pandunia differ from other auxiliary languages?

- The vocabulary of Pandunia is evenly global. It consists of Western (Greco-Latin) words, Perso-Arabic words, Chinese words and Indian words. Most of the other auxiliary languages use only Western words and, because they were created in the late 1800s and the early 1900s, their creators considered them "civilized" words and the others were "barbaric".
- Internationality is the main criterion for selecting words to Pandunia. All the words of Pandunia are known by many nations in some part of the world.
- The grammar of Pandunia is minimal but very flexible. Pandunia has only a few grammatical structures, which are re-used over and over again.
- Pandunia is a truly neutral language. It's not meant to imitate any languages, whereas for example Esperanto, Ido and Interlingua are intentionally close to the European languages.


#### Did Esperanto and its kind influence Pandunia?

Yes, with a limited effect.

Esperanto has an ingenious system for marking parts of speech (PoS) with vowel endings. In Esperanto nouns end in -o, adjectives end in -a, verbs in -i and adverbs in -e. (These are the dictionary forms. Some of them are inflected in actual use.) Similar PoS marking systems are used in the offshoots of Esperanto. Most notable offshoots are Ido and Novial. In Novial the endings are different: nouns end in -e or -um, adjectives in -i, verbs in -a and adverbs in -men. Almost all words were marked with the part of speech markers in Esperanto and its kind.

Pandunia is different. It has part of speech markers for the noun, the verb and the adjective, but they are not always required. For example, when the root word is an adjective, it doesn't need the adjectival ending. Moreover, the endings are never inflected in Pandunia. So Pandunia is, in its core, a completely different type of language.
