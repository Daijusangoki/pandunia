# Pandunia word by word

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**suba salam!** Good morning!

**den salam!** Good day!

**cam salam!** Good evening!

**notce salam!** Good night!

**yem salam!** Bon appetit!

**lai salam!** Welcome!

**safar salam!** Have a safe journey!

**son salam!** Sleep well!

Tip: As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!



### mi <small>I, me</small>

**mi salam mama.** I greet mother.

**mi salam papa.** I greet father.

**salam mama!** Hello, mother!

**salam papa!** Hello, father!

**mimen salam mama.** We greet mother.



### ti <small>you</small>

**mi salam ti.** I greet you.

**ti salam mi.** You greet me.

Tip: The basic word order is subject-verb-object. Words don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **mi** stays the same in Pandunia, but in English 'I' changes to 'me'.

**salam ti!** Hello you!

Note:  **Ti** means one single person only. The plural pronoun is **timen**, "you all".

**mi salam timen.** I greet you all.

**salam timen!** Hello you all!



### e <small>to be</small>

**mi e tomas.** I am Thomas.

**ti e sara.** You are Sara.

**mau e hewan.** The cat is an animal.

Note: Like every word in Pandunia, **e** is unchanging. So _am, is, are, was_ and _were_ are all translated **e** in Pandunia! In addition, in simple phrases it's allowed to leave out **e** after a pronoun like **mi** and **ti**.

**mi sara.** I'm Sara.

**ti tomas.** You're Thomas.



### ta <small>he, she or it</small>

**ta e fem.** She is a woman.

**ta e man.** He is a man.

**ta e pingo.** It is an apple.

Tip: **Ta** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as things. As you can guess, **Tamen** means "they".

**tamen e pingo.** They are apples.

**mimen salam tamen.** We greet them.

**mimen salam timen.** We greet you.



### ke? <small>what? who?</small>

**ke?** What?

**ti e ke?** Who are you?
**mi e tomas.** I'm Thomas.

**ta e ke?** Who is he/she?
**ta e sara.** She is Sara.

**timen e ke?** Who are you people?

**tamen e ke?** Who are they?



### sa <small>this, that</small>

**sa e ke? / ke e sa?** What's this?

**sa e pingo.** This is an apple.

**sa e ruje pingo.** This is a red apple.

**sa pingo ruje.** This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **ruje**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.



### nam <small>be called, name</small>

**ti nam ke?** What's your name?

**mi nam tomas.** My name is Thomas.

**ta nam ke?** What's his/her name?

**ta nam sara.** Her name is Sara.



### kia <small>to ask a question</small>

**kia ti e tomas?** Are you Thomas?

**kia ti e doktor?** Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **kia**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **mi kia ti doktor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**kia ti bon?** How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)
**mi bon.** I'm good.
**ti ne?** And you?

**kia ti vol yem koi?** Would you like to eat something?

**ta yem pingo.** He/she eats an apple.

Note: Unlike English, Pandunia doesn't have separate singular and plural forms. Therefore a word like **pingo** can refer to one or more apples.

**kia ti yem kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**mi yem kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **yem** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy!

**mi yem kafe i pan.** I'm having coffee and bread.



### vol <small>want</small>

**kia ti vol yem?** Would you like to eat?

**ti vol yem ke?** What would you like to eat?

Tip: While English puts the "what" at the beginning of a question, in Pandunia the word order is not affected by the **ke**.

**mi vol yem kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia ti vol yem tca?** Would you like to drink tea?
**no. mi no vol tca. mi vol kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.

**ti vol ke pingo?** Which apple do you want?
**sa ruje.** This red one.



### bite <small>request, please</small>

**mi bite ti yem tca.** I ask you to drink tea.

**mi bite ti lai jia.** I ask you to come home.

**mi bite ti mede mi.** I ask you to help me.
