# Pandunia word by word

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

English speakers will find it easy to make basic sentences in Pandunia as the word order is generally the same as in English, there are no definite or indefinite articles, no verb "to be", and no complicated rules about changing the form of words to express singular and plural or the tense of verbs.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### SALAM <small>greet, greeting</small>

SALAM! - Hello!

SUBA SALAM! - Good morning!

DEN SALAM! - Good day!

XAM SALAM! - Good evening!

NOCE SALAM! - Good night!

NYAM SALAM! - Bon appetit!

LAI SALAM! - Welcome!

GO SALAM! - Goodbye!

SAFAR SALAM! - Have a safe journey!

SON SALAM! - Sleep well!

As you can see from the range of expressions, SALAM is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!

SALAM is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and non-religious people in many different countries around the world.

<small>Etymology. SALAM is from Arabic: سَلَام‏ "salām", Hebrew: שָׁלוֹם‏ "šalom", Turkish: selam, Hindi: सलाम "salām", Swahili: salaam, Indonesian: selamat.</small>



### MI <small>I, me</small>

MI SARA. - I'm Sara.

MI TOMAS. - I'm Thomas.

You can introduce yourself simply by saying MI and your name. You don't need a verb for saying it in Pandunia!

MI SALAM MA. - I greet mother.

MI SALAM PA. - I greet father.

The basic word order in Pandunia is subject-verb-object.

SARA SALAM TOMAS. - Sara greets Thomas.

SALAM MA! - Greetings, mother!

SALAM PA! - Greetings, father!

<small>Etymology. MI is from English: me, Italian: mi, Swahili: mimi, Zulu: -mi-.</small>




### TU <small>you</small>

TU TOMAS. - You are Thomas.

MI SALAM TU. - I greet you.

TU SALAM MI. - You greet me.

Pronouns don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why MI is the same in subject and object positions while English has two different forms, 'I' and 'me'.

MI AMA TU. - I love you.

<small>Etymology. TU is from Spanish: "tú", Italian: "tu", French: "tu", Hindi: तू  "tū", Farsi: تو‏‎ "to", Tajik: ту "tu".</small>



### YE <small>he, she or it</small>

YE MAN. - He is a man.

YE FEM. - She is a woman.

YE PINGO. - It is an apple.

YE is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as for things.

MI SALAM YE. - I greet him/her.

<small>Etymology. YE is from Lingala: yé, Swahili: yeye, Chichewa: iye, Zulu: -ye-, Hindi: यह  "ye".</small>



### KIA <small>to ask a question</small>

KIA TU TOMAS? - Are you Thomas?

KIA TU DOKTOR? - Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with KIA. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from MI KIA TU DOKTOR (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

KIA TU BON? - How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
MI BON. - I'm good.  
KIA TU? - And you?  
MI NO BON. - I'm not good.

<small>Etymology. KIA is from Hindi: क्या  "kyā", Urdu: كيا‏‎ "kyā", Japanese: 聞く "kiku".</small>



### SI <small>yes</small>

KIA TU TOMAS? - Are you Thomas.

SI, MI TOMAS. - Yes, I am Thomas.

KIA YE DOKTOR? - Is he/she a doctor?

SI, YE SI DOKTOR. - Yes, he is a doctor.

The word SI affirms a predicate, which the speaker considers to be a fact.

MI SI TOMAS. - I am Thomas.

TU SI SARA. - You are Sara.

Tip: It's particularly useful to put SI between two nouns that would otherwise be misunderstood as a compound word.

PINGO: PAL. - The apple, a fruit.

PINGO PAL. - The apple-fruit.

PINGO SI PAL. - The apple _is_ a fruit.

<small>Etymology. SI is from Spanish: sí, Italian: sì, Portuguese: sim, Mandarin: 是 "shì", Wu Chinese: 是 "sí".</small>



### NO <small>no, not</small>

MI NO SARA. - I'm not Sara.

MI NO DOKTOR. - I'm not a doctor.

KIA TU BON? - Are you well?  
SI. MI BON. - Yes, I'm well.

KIA TU BON? - Are you well?  
NO, MI NO BON. - No, I'm not well.

You can use NO to deny anything. It is placed before the word that is denied.

YE NO SALAM MI. - He/she doesn't greet me.

<small>Etymology. NO is from English: no, Spanish: no, French: non.</small>



### MEN <small>people</small>

Add MEN to a singular pronoun to make it plural.

MIMEN SALAM TUMEN. - We greet you all.

TUMEN SALAM YEMEN. - You greet them.

YEMEN SALAM MIMEN! - They greet us.

MIMEN SI FEM. - We are women.

TUMEN SI MAN. - You are men.

<small>Etymology. MEN is from Mandarin: 们 "men", English: men (people in general).</small>

SA KE? / KE SA? - What's this?

SA SI PINGO. - This is an apple.

SA SI ROS PINGO. This is a red apple.

SA PINGO ROS. - This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like ROS, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.

YE ROS. It's red.



### DI <small>'s (possessive particle)</small>

SA KE? - What's this?

SA MI DI FON. - It's my phone.

SA KE DI? - Whose is this?

SA MI DI. - It's mine.

YE KE? - Who's he/she?

YE SI MI DI PANYO. - He/she is my friend.

MI SI SARA DI PANYO. - I am Sara's friend.

<small>Etymology. DI is from Mandarin: 的 "de, di".</small>

### WOL <small>want</small>
