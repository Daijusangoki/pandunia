# Basic Rules

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
    - Every word is read as it is written.
    - No letter is silent.
    - Only the lower-case letters are necessary for writing.
2. The syllable before the last consonant of the word is stressed.
3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
    - Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
4. Adjectives come before the noun and they frequently end in -i.
    - ex. **bon pan** = Good bread. **pan bon** = Bread good.
5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.
    - The main word stands at the end.
    - ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox
6. Verbs that end in -a indicate subject-verb-object word order.
    - ex. **mi kana pan.** = I eat bread.
7. Verbs that end in -u indicate object-verb-subject word order.
    - ex. **pan kanu mi.** = Bread is eaten by me.
8. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the next verb in the sentence. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.
    - ex. **mi cing tu kana kafe.** = I ask you to drink coffee.
9. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **mi kia tu baxa pandunia?** → **kia tu baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **mi cing tu loga ming.** →  **cing loga ming.** = Please speak clearly.
10. The part-of-speech marking vowel may be dropped from nouns and adjectives.
