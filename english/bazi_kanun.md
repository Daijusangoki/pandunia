# Basic Rules

1. Every word is read as it is written. No letter is silent. Only the lower-case letters are necessary.
2. The stress is on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
4. An adjective is placed before its head word and it functions as a modifier. Frequently adjectives end in **-i**.
    - ex. **bon pan** = Good bread. **pan bon** = Bread good.
5. Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them. The main word stands at the end.
    - ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox
6. Sentences with active verbs have subject-verb-object word order. Most active verbs end in **-a**.
    - ex. **mi penta meza.** = I paint tables.
7. A sentence with passive meaning has only a subject and a verb. Most passive verbs end in **-u**.
    - ex. **meza pentu.** = The table gets painted.
8. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the next verb in the sentence. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.
    - ex. **mi cing tu kana kafe.** = I ask you to drink coffee.
9. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **mi kia tu baxa pandunia?** → **kia tu baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **mi cing tu loga ming.** →  **cing loga ming.** = Please speak clearly.


## 1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.

Pandunia has _phonetic spelling_. Every word is read as it is written. No letter is silent. Only the lower-case letters are necessary.


## 2. The syllable before the last consonant of the word is stressed.


## 3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.

Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.


## 4. Adjectives come before the noun and they frequently end in -i.

An adjective is placed before its head word and it functions as a modifier. Frequently adjectives end in **-i**.

Ex. **bon pan** = Good bread. **pan bon** = Bread good.


## 5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.

Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them. The main word stands at the end.

Ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox

## 6. Verbs that end in -a indicate subject-verb-object word order.

Ex. **mi penta meza.** = I paint tables.

## 7. Verbs that end in -u indicate object-verb-subject word order.

Ex. **meza pentu.** = The table gets painted.

## 8. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the next verb in the sentence. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.

Ex. **mi cing tu kana kafe.** = I ask you to drink coffee.

## 9. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.

- **mi kia tu baxa pandunia?** → **kia tu baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
- **mi cing tu loga ming.** →  **cing loga ming.** = Please speak clearly.

## 10. The part-of-speech marking vowel may be dropped.
