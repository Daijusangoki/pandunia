# Basic Rules

## The basic rules

These are the 11 basic rules of Pandunia language.

1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.
2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.
4. The adjectives and the adverb have the same form. They come before the word that they modify.
5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.
6. Verbs that end in -a indicate subject-verb-object word order.
7. Verbs that end in -u indicate object-verb-subject word order.
8. The verbs do not change for person or number.
9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb functions as the subject of the next verb.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
11. Derived words carry an optional ending. Adjectives end in -i, nouns end in -e, and verbs end in -a or -u.


## The rules with examples

#### 1. The spelling follows the pronunciation exactly.

- Each letter has always the same sound.
- No letter is silent.
- Only the lower-case letters are necessary for writing.


#### 2. The stress is placed on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.


#### 3. Nouns have a single, unchanging form.

Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.

Basic nouns that are derived from verbs end in -e.


#### 4. The adjectives and the adverb have the same form. They come before the word that they modify.

**bon sone.** - good sleep  
**ye bon sona.** - He/she sleeps well.


#### 5. Compound words are formed by putting words side by side.
The main word stands at the end.
Ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox


#### 6. Verbs that end in -a indicate subject-verb-object word order.
Ex. **mi kana pan.** = I eat bread.


#### 7. Verbs that end in -u indicate object-verb-subject word order.
Ex. **pan kanu mi.** = Bread is eaten by me.


#### 8. The verbs do not change for person or number.

The person and the number are indicated by the subject.
 
**mi kana.** - I eat.  
**tu kana.** - You eat.  
**ye kana.** - He or she eats.  
**mimen kana.** - We eat.  
**tumen kana.** - You all eat.  
**yemen kana.** - They eat.
 
The tense is indicated by time adverbs, which are used only when it is necessary.
 
- **pas** (past) denotes the past tense.
- **zay** (present) denotes the present tense.
- **futur** (future) denotes the future tense.
 

#### 9. In the _pivot structure_, the object of the transitive verb functions as the subject of the next verb.
Ex. **mi cing tu kana kafe.** = I ask you to drink coffee.

#### 10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
- **mi kia tu baxa pandunia?** → **kia tu baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
- **mi cing tu loga ming.** →  **cing loga ming.** = Please speak clearly.

#### 11. Derived words carry an optional ending. Adjectives end in -i, nouns end in -e, and verbs end in -a or -u.
