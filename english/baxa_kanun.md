When talking about grammar, many people first think of marking of person, tense, mood, case, number and gender in words, and usage of articles, prepositions and other so called _grammar words_ and the rules that govern them. For many, they are the natural building blocks of grammar and they can't imagine a language without them. The grammar of Pandunia is different. It doesn't have any grammatical markings and there are very few rules that concern specific words.

Structurally Pandunia is an isolating language. In Pandunia, all words are unchanging – they aren't ever inflected, and there are no endings like the plural -s or -es in English. So instead of the form, it is the _meaning_ of words that matters, and their place in the sentence.

These are the reasons why an isolating structure was chosen for Pandunia, the global contact language:

- Natural isolating languages are not uncommon. They are particularly common in Southeast Asia, Oceania and West Africa.
    - The Chinese languages are isolating. This includes Mandarin Chinese, which is spoken by more native speakers than any other language on earth.
    - Also several other isolating languages are spoken by millions of speakers, such as Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, Yoruba and Igbo.
- Spontaneously created _contact languages_ tend to be isolating. This applies also to most instances of _pidgin English_.
- It's easier to learn _just words_ than to learn rules and their exceptions.
    - Isolating languages are considered to be generally easier to learn than inflectional and agglutinating languages.
    - Usually learners speak an isolating variant of the target language at first anyway, for example a kind of "broken English".
- The gap between a beginner and a fluent speaker is more narrow and less obvious for an isolating language than for inflectional languages.
- It's easier to borrow words in all shapes and forms when the grammar doesn't set any morphological criteria.

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Rules
-----------

1. Every word is read as it is written. No letter is silent. Only the lower-case letters are necessary.
2. The stress accent is on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
4. Adjectives are placed after the noun that they modify.
    - ex. **gar bon** = Good car. **gar nova** new car.
5. Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them. The first word is the main word.
    - ex. **sanduk poste** = mailbox (box of mail)
6. Sentences with transitive verbs have normally subject-verb-object word order.
    - ex. **me penta meza.** = I paint tables.
    - ex. **ni kaput ta.** = You broke it.
7. A sentence with passive meaning can have only a subject and a verb.
    - ex. **ta kaput.** = It is broken.
8. Beginning of the verb phrase is marked by a personal pronoun or a tense, aspect or mood particle.
    - **memen baxa pandunia.** = We speak Pandunia.
    - **jen ya baxa pandunia.** = People _indeed_ speak Pandunia.
9. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the next verb in the sentence. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.
    - ex. **me cing ni dar pesa.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **me kia ni baxa pandunia?** → **kia ni baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **me cing ni loga klar.** →  **cing loga klar.** = Please speak clearer.




Parts of speech
---------------

All words are invariable in Pandunia. There is no inflexion of any kind. That's why the parts of speech depend on the meaning of words, not on the form.

The parts of speech in Pandunia are:

1. The noun names a thing, a person, an abstract concept or a proper name, ex. stone, table, robot, cat, human, city, london.
2. The modifier is a word that adds some quality to the thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.
3. The numeral is a word that tells the number or amount of things.
4. The verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.
5. The particle is a structural or an abstract word, ex. yes, no, but, if.



Nouns
-----

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batu** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
> **meza** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
> **kursi** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
> **sui** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the word **surya** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and our only moon.

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The first word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the following words only modify its meaning.

> **guang surya** - sun light  
> **guang luna** - moon light  
> **batu luna** - moon stone

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

> **batu batu** - stones, lots of stones
> **tara tara** - stars, lots of stars



Modifiers
---------

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality for another word. In Pandunia modifiers come after the noun that they modify.

> **batu dai** - big stone
> **batu cung** - heavy stone  
> **meza dai** - big table  
> **meza gau** - high table  
> **kursi bon** - good chair  

Modifiers can modify also verbs. Then they function like English adverbs.

> **me son _bon_.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **ni baxa _bon_ pandunia.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.

Compare:

> **ni baxa pandunia _bon_.** - You speak _good_ Pandunia.


Numerals
--------

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about. For example, the word **surya** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un tara** - one star  
> **du tara** - two stars  
> **sam tara** - three stars  
> **xau tara** - few stars  
> **poli tara** - many stars

> **un dai meza** - one big table  
> **du dai kursi** - two big chairs  
> **sam bon kursi** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen du** - the second part (part two)
> **fen sam** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **sam**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **set**
- 8 **bat**
- 9 **noi**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another – exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un du**
- 13 **un sam**
- 20 **du nul**
- 21 **du un**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **du nul nul** or **du hon**


Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    


Pronouns
--------

### Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**me** - I, me  
**ni** - you  
**ta** - he, she, it  
**memen** - we  
**nimen** - you all  
**tamen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**me vide se** - I see myself.  
**ta vide se** - She sees herself. / He sees himself.  
**memen vide se.** - We see ourselves.  


### Demonstrative pronouns

Pandunia has two demonstrative pronouns.

**ye** - this here  
**sa** - that there  

The demonstrative pronouns stand before the noun that they modify.

> **ye batu** - this stone  
> **ye sam batu** - these three stones  
> **sa batu.** - that stone  
> **sa batu cung.** - that heavy stone  


### Interrogative pronoun

**Ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of English words _who, what_ and _which_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?  
> **ke xe?** - What? (Which thing?)  
> **ke jen?** - Who? (Which person?)  
> **ke sat?** - When? (What time?)  
> **ke yang?** - How? (What manner?)  
> **ke koz?** - Why? (What cause?)  



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Statements

### Predicates of state

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In Pandunia, every statement sentence begins with a personal pronoun. In the simplest sentences, the subject is a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective.

> **me bon.** - I am good.  
> **ni sundar.** - You are beautiful.  
> **ta jovan.** - He/she is young.  
> **tamen jovan.** - They are young.  

The predicate can be also a noun or a noun phrase.

> **ta sara.** - She is Sara.  
> **ta batu.** - It is a stone.  
> **ta batu cung.** - It is a heavy stone.  
> **me man jovan.** - I'm a young man.  

When the subject is a noun or a noun phrase, it is immediately followed by the reflexive pronoun (**se**). The reflexive pronoun always refers back to the most recent subject.

> **sara se fem jovan.** - Sara is a young woman.  
> **batu se cung.** - Stones are heavy.  
> **jovan se sundar.** - Young is beautiful.  

To deny something, use the word **no**.

> **ta no sara.** - He/she is not Sara.  
> **batu se no hewan.** - Stone is not an animal.  
> **jovan se no sundar.** - Young is not beautiful.  


### Active statements

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is an action word (verb). Every action-word can function as a noun too, but in a statement it is activated by a personal pronoun.

> **vide** - sight; seeing; to see  
> **un vide long** - a long sight  
> **me vide.** - I see.  

Active sentences have normally the subject–verb–object word order (SVO). The object is immediately after the verb.

> **me vide ni.** - I see you.  
> **ni vide me.** - You see me.  
> **ta yem pingo.** - He/she eats apples.  
> **tamen ting musik.** - They hear music.  

### Passive statements

In passive sentences, the subject is the undergoer of the action and there is no object.

**Be** is the passive verb. It indicates that the subject is the object of an action. It is a _core verb_, so you don't need to use **se** before it.

> **ni be vide.** - You get seen.  
> **pingo be yem.** - Apples get eaten.  


The agent can be mentioned with the help of preposition **de**.

> **ni be vide de me.** - You are seen by me.  
> **pingo be yem de tamen.** - Apples are eaten by them.  

It is also possible to put the agent in the beginning of the sentence. This results into a kind of subject-object-verb (SOV) word order.

> **me tamen be vide.** - _I them see._ (I see them.)  
> **tamen pingo be yem.** - _They apples eat._ (They eat apples.)  
> **un man se pingo be yem.** - _A man an apple eats._ (A man eats an apple.)


### Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in series.
 
1. **me go jia.** - I go home.  
2. **me ken go jia.** - I can go home.  
3. **me vol ken go jia.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I want can go home_!)
 
Also the passive verb **be** can be part of a serial verb.

> **tamen no vol be vide.** - They don't want to be seen.


 
### Pivot structure

When the predicate has an object, the object can begin a new predicate. This is called the _pivot structure_.

> **me vol ni yem sabzi.** - I want (that) you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **me vol** has **ni** as its object. At the same time, **ni** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **yem sabzi**. So **ni** is the _pivot_ of the sentence.



### Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

> **me cing ni lai.** - I ask you to come.  
> **cing lai!** - Please come! (Literally: _Request come!_)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Particles
---------


### Affirmation and negation

Particle **ya** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **Ya** affirms something, whereas **no** denies it.

> **kia ti baxa pandunia?** - Do you speak Pandunia?  
> **ya, me ya baxa ta.** - Yes, I indeed speak it.  
> **no, me no baxa ta.** - No, I don't speak it.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **me vide ni.** - I see you.  
> **me no vide ni.** - I don't see you.  
> **me vide no ni ama tamen.** - I see, not you, but them.

The particles **ya** and **no** are used for answering questions.

> **kia ni vide me?** - Do you see me?  
> **ya. (me vide ni.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
> **no. (me no vide ni.)** - No. (I don't see you.)


### Modifier particle

Particle **de** is used for marking possession and modification in general. It connects the modified word to the modifier.

#### Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun. **De** works like "of" in English.

> **mama de maria** - the mother of Maria
> **dom de me** - the house of mine  
> **dom de papa de me** - the house of the father of mine

#### Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun.

Normal adjective can be made more emphratic with the help of **de**.

> **dom nova** - new house  
> **dom de nova** - house _of new_

The modifier particle is used also for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

> **lab de rang roza** - lips of the color of the rose  
> **mat de rang sama** - eyes of the color of the sky

#### Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particle. Here **de** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_.

> **ta e man _de me vide_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause.

> **me vide man _de yem pingo_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  


### Mood Particles

Mood particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener. Mood particles are commonly used in many languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a mood particle modifies the following word, or the whole sentence, when the mood particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

> **ta yem bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ta yem plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ta plus yem bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ta yem bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Note! Adjectives modify always the previous word only.

> **me kitab bon buk.** - I write well books.
> **me kitab buk bon.** - I write good books.

In addition, mood particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, that adjectives can't modify.


### Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed. The general time words are **gon** (past), **ja** (already),  **nun** (present) and **futur** (future). They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **me ha mau gon.** - I have had cats in the past.  
> **me ha mau ja.** - I had cats.  
> **ama me no ha mau nun.** - But I don't have cats now.  
> **munkin me ha mau futur.** - Maybe I have cats in the future.  

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prepositions
------------

### Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has three prepositions of place and time.

1. **na** - location or moment (in general): at, in, on, during
2. **ze** - origin or beginning: from, since
3. **do** - destination or end: to, till, until

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **me lai jia.** - I come home.  
> **ni sit kursi.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
> **ta lala sofa.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
> **maci nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
> **jen jang se marce dau.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **me na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
> **me son na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
> **me son ze xam do suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
> **me safar ze london do paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they refer to time.

> **me deng ze ni go.** - I have waited since you left.  
> **me deng do ni lai jia.** - I wait until you come home.  
> **me deng na ni son.** - I wait while you sleep.  

More precise expressions of place and time are expressed with _a preposition + a place word + **de**_.

> **na dur de** - for the time/duration of  
> **me deng na dur de ni son.** - I wait for the time when you sleep.  
> **na lok de** - at the place of  
> **me deng na lok de ni toka.** - I wait at the place where you left.  
> **na xia de** - under, below  
> **un waf lala na xia de meza.** - A dog lies under the table.  
> **na par de** - on the surface of  
> **un mau lala na par de meza.** - A cat lies on the table.

Similar meaning can be expressed also with compound words.

> **un mau lala na par meza.** - A cat lies at the tabletop.

In addition, a preposition can be followed immediately by a verb.

> **dur** - to last, to take time
> **me deng na dur ni son.** - _I wait during you sleep._


### Prepositions of manner

Preposition **bi** indicates means. It corresponds to English prepositions _with_ and _by (by means of)_. The meaning of **bi** is very broad. Often it is followed by another word that defines the meaning more precisely.

> **me kat pan bi kati.** - I cut bread with a knife.  
> **me kat pan bi yung kati.** - I cut bread by using a knife.

Prepositions **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

> **me sabi pandunia ka guru.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**Ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In the above example **sabi** (know) is the verb and **guru** (master) is the point of comparison.

**Ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

> **ban e min dai ka papa.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
> **opa e sem dai ka papa.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**Ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min** (less) and **sem** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is **papa** (father) in the examples above.




### List of compound prepositions

**na ante** before. **na bada** after.  
**na cen** in front. **na pice** behind.  
**na xia** under, below. **na gau** over, above.  
**na jin** near. **na far** far away. **na visin** beside, next to.

### Hierarchy of Word Types

Spoken language is a flow of sounds which constitute words. Written language, in the case of Pandunia, is a flow of letters from left to right, which constitute words. So every expression is essentially a sequence of words. However all words are not equal. There is a hierarchy of words. The verb is the structural center of a sentence and other words are directly or indirectly connected to it.

Each sentence can be drawn as a tree diagram, where the central words are above and the dependant words are below. For example the sentence **me vide ni** (I see you) can be pictured as a tree as follows.

    me vide ni.

       vide
      ┌─┴─┐
     me   ni

Adjectives and numerals point to their head word, the noun.

    me vide sam jen jovan.

       vide
      ┌─┴──┐
     me   sam
           |
          jen
           |
         jovan

The hierarchy of word types in Pandunia from the more to the less central is as follows.

1. Conjunctions: i, u
2. Connectors: ge, de
3. Coverbs (prepositions): na, do, ze, bi
4. Verbs
5. Nouns and pronouns
6. Tense, aspect and mood particles
7. Numerals
8. Adjectives

The following example shows how the scope affects the final position of words in the tree hierarchy. For example, although **i** is in general higher than **koz**, here its scope is only to connect **yusef** and **sara**. **Ze koz de** is at the top, because it connects the two sub-phrases.


    yusef i sara vol darsa pandunia ze koz de ta e dunia baxa bon.

                      ze koz de
               ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              vol                    e
          ┌────┴──────┐           ┌──┴──┐
          i         darsa        ta    baxa
      ┌───┴───┐    ┌──┴────┐            |
    yusef   sara       pandunia       dunia
                                        |
                                       bon
