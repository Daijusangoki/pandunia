## Grammar

A noun is a name of a person or a thing. Here are some nouns: **ban** (friend), **pa** (father), **ma** (mother), **mau** (cat), **waf** (dog).

Pandunia doesn’t have singular and plural forms. You can repeat the word to say that there are many of them.

**mau mau.** - Many cats.  
**waf waf.** - Many dogs.

A pronoun is a word that can take place of a noun. Pandunia’s pronouns are: **me** (I), **ni** (you), **ta** (he, she or it), **nime** (we = me and you), **tame** (we = me and them), **nini** (you all), **tata** (they).

The simplest phrase consists of a pronoun and a noun.

**me ban.** - I’m a friend.  
**ni pa.** - You are a father.  
**ta ma.** - She is a mother.  
**tata ma.** - They are mothers.

**no** means no.

**me no ban.** - I’m not a friend.
**ni no pa.** - You are not a father.
**ta no ma.** - She is not a mother.
**tata no ma.** - They are not mothers.

“ye” means yes. You have to use “ye” or “no” when there’s no pronoun.

**ma no pa.** - Mother is not father.  
**mau no waf.** - The cat is not a dog. 
**mau ye ban.** - The cat is a friend.  
**waf ye ban.** - The dog is a friend.

A verb is a word for action. Pandunia has the same word order as English. So the word order is subject–verb–object.

**me si ma.** - I see mother.  
**ma ye si me.** - Mother sees me.

ta ye mi jan de ban. - He is my known friend.

Different orders of the subject, the main verb and the object are gotten with the help of additional verbs bei and ba. The object can be moved before the main verb.

**me bat ni.** = I hit you.  
**ni bei bat.** = You suffer (a) hit.  
**ni bei me bat.** = You suffer (from) me (a) hit.  
**me ba ni bat.** = I submit you hit. (Minä alistan/altistan sinut lyönnille.)

Prepositions:  
**na, do, ze, be**
