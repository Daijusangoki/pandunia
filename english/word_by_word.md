# Pandunia word by word

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. There are generally four major things that make a language easy or hard for learners.

1. How closely it is related to the languages that you already know?
2. How simple or complex its system of sounds is?
3. How complicated its grammar is?
4. How differently it has to be used in different social situations?

Pandunia responds to all of these requirements.

1. It has lots of loan words from all over the world, so every learner will be familiar with some of it.
2. Pandunia has relatively simple pronunciation. Most of its consonants and vowels are among the most common sounds found in world languages. Also its words are mostly 2-3 syllables long.
3. It has a straightforward grammar, which is regular and analytic. Words are not inflected, which is particularly helpful for beginners.
4. As a constructed language, Pandunia is free from awkward cultural traditions. You don't have to talk in different ways to different people, such as a friend, a stranger or your superior. You can just speak it!

This is a course for learning Pandunia rapidly through words. The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces a new word, which is repeated several times in the lesson in various phrases. The lesson can include also other new words, but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn them all at once. Just concentrate on the main word and how it works with other words.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify usage patterns and grammatical details.

Are you ready? Let's begin!


Part 1: Greeting and introduction
---------------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**suba salam!** Good morning!

**den salam!** Good day!

**xam salam!** Good evening!

**noce salam!** Good night!

**lai salam!** Welcome!

**safar salam!** Have a safe journey!

Tip: As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!



### me <small>I, me</small>

**me salam mama.** I greet mother.

**mama salam me.** Mother greets me.

Tip: The basic word order is subject-verb-object. Words don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **me** stays the same in Pandunia, but in English 'I' changes to 'me'.

**salam mama!** Hello, mother!

**salam papa!** Hello, father!



### ni <small>you</small>

**me salam ni.** I greet you.

**salam ni!** Hello you!

Tip: Two more pronouns are created from **ni**. **Nini** is means "you all". **Nime** means _you and me_, so it is the inclusive form of "we" (for two or more persons).

**nime salam mama.** We greet mother.

**me salam nini.** I greet you all.

**salam nini!** Hello you all!



### ta <small>he, she or it</small>

**ta fem.** She is a woman.

**ta man.** He is a man.

**ta pingo.** It is an apple.

Tip: **Ta** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as things. As you can guess, **tata** means "they" and **tame** means _them and me_, so it is the exclusive form of "we".

**nime salam tata.** We greet them.

**tame salam nini.** We greet you.



### ke? <small>what? who?</small>

**ke?** What?

**ni ke?** Who are you?
**me tomas.** I'm Thomas.

**ta ke?** Who is he/she?
**ta sara.** She is Sara.

**nini ke?** Who are you people?

**tata ke?** Who are they?



### sa <small>this, that</small>

**sa ke? / ke sa?** What's this?

**sa ye pingo.** This is an apple.

**sa ye roxu pingo.** This is a red apple.

**sa pingo roxu.** This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **roxu**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.



### nam <small>name</small>

**ni nam ke?** What's your name?

**me nam tomas.** My name is Thomas.

**ta nam ke?** What's his/her name?

**ta nam sara.** Her name is Sara.


### kia <small>to ask a question</small>

**kia ni tomas?** Are you Thomas?

**kia ni doktor?** Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **kia**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **me kia ni doktor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**kia ni bon?** How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)
**me bon.** I'm good.
**ni ne?** And you?
**me no bon.** I'm not good.



### ye <small>yes</small>

**kia ni bon?** Are you well?
**ye. me bon.** Yes, I'm well.

**kia ha doktor?** Is there a doctor?
**ye. sa man ye doktor.** Yes. That man is a doctor.

Tip: The word **ye** is often used in place of "to be". But it is commonly left out after pronouns like **me**, **ni** and **ta**.

**sa fem ye doktor.** That woman is a doctor.

**ta doktor.** She is a doctor.


### no <small>no, not</small>

**me no doktor.** I'm not a doctor.

**sa man no doktor.** That man is not a doctor.

**sa pingo no roxu.** - This apple is not red.




## Part 2


### yem <small>eat, drink</small>

**ta yem pingo.** He/she eats an apple.

**tata yem pingo.** They eat apples.

Note: Unlike English, Pandunia doesn't have separate singular and plural forms. Therefore a word like **pingo** can refer to one or more apples.

**kia ni yem kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**me yem kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **yem** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy!

**me yem kafe i pan.** I'm having coffee and bread.



### vole <small>want</small>

**ni vole yem ke?** What would you like to eat?

Tip: While English puts the "what" at the beginning of a question, in Pandunia the word order is not affected by the **ke**.

**me vole yem kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia ni vole yem ca?** Would you like to drink tea?
**no. me no vole ca. me vole kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.

**ni vole ke pingo?** Which apple do you want?
**sa roxu.** This red one.



### cing <small>request, please</small>

**me cing ni yem ca.** I ask you to drink tea.

**me cing ni lai jia.** I ask you to come home.

**cing lai jia.** Please, come home!

**cing mede me.** Please, help me.



### danku <small>thank</small>

**danku ni.** Thank you.

**me danku ni.** I thank you.

**me danku ni mede me.** I thank you for helping me.

**danku ni mede me.** Thanks for helping me.

Grammar
-------

This part is for those who want to understand the mechanics of the language. It's not mandatory to read it. You can learn Pandunia perfectly well by studying example sentences and words. Remember, a language is learned _for real_ by using it, not by learning a set of rules!

Pandunia is an analytic language. It means that its grammar is all about the word order (i.e. the syntax). It doesn't deal with words because all words are separate, unchanging and uninflected. The role of a word is decided by its place in a sentence, not by its form or ending!

Basically the grammar of Pandunia consists of sentence templates. The fundamental ones are listed below.

PP : personal pronoun
NP : noun phrase
TAM : tense, aspect or mood particle

1. Noun phrase (NP) types
    1. noun

    5. verb + noun : compound word
        - **yem ci** : eater (eating doer)
    6. verb + verb
        - **baxa loji** communication study
    7. number + adjective + noun
        - **du roxu hua** two red flowers
2. Predicate phrase types
    1. PP + NP : predicate of identity
        - **me man.** - I'm a man.
        - **ta sara.** - She is Sara.
    2. NP + TAM + NP : predicate of identity
        - **sa fem ye sara.** That woman is Sara.
    3. NP + (TAM) + adjective : predicate of state
        - **hua roxu.** Flower is red.
        - **sa hua gon roxu.** That flower was red.
    4. PP + verb + NP : active predicate
        - **me vide un roxu hua.** I see a red flower.
    5. NP + TAM + verb + NP : active predicate
        - **sara ye vide le roxu hua.** Sara sees the red flower.
        - **tim no vide ta.** Tim doesn't see it.
    6. PP + verb + PP + verb + NP : the pivot structure

    7. verb + PP + verb + NP : template for questions and other modalities
