# Pandunia word by word

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. There are generally four major things that make a language easy or hard for learners.

1. How closely it is related to the languages that you already know?
2. How simple or complex its system of sounds is?
3. How complicated its grammar is?
4. How differently it has to be used in different social situations?

Pandunia responds to all of these requirements.

1. It has lots of loan words from all over the world, so every learner will be familiar with some of it.
2. Pandunia has relatively simple pronunciation. Most of its consonants and vowels are among the most common sounds found in world languages. Also its words are mostly 2-3 syllables long.
3. It has a straightforward grammar, which is regular and analytic. Words are not inflected, which is particularly helpful for beginners.
4. As a constructed language, Pandunia is free from awkward cultural traditions. You don't have to talk in different ways to different people, such as a friend, a stranger or your superior. You can just speak it!

This is a course for learning Pandunia rapidly through words. The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces a new word, which is repeated several times in the lesson in various phrases. The lesson can include also other new words, but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn them all at once. Just concentrate on the main word and how it works with other words.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify usage patterns and grammatical details.




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**suba salam!** Good morning!

**den salam!** Good day!

**xam salam!** Good evening!

**noce salam!** Good night!

**yem salam!** Bon appetit!

**lai salam!** Welcome!

**safar salam!** Have a safe journey!

Tip: As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!



### mi <small>I, me</small>

**mi salam mama.** I greet mother.

**mi salam papa.** I greet father.

**salam mama!** Hello, mother!

**salam papa!** Hello, father!

**mimen salam mama.** We greet mother.



### ti <small>you</small>

**mi salam ti.** I greet you.

**ti salam mi.** You greet me.

Tip: The basic word order is subject-verb-object. Words don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **mi** stays the same in Pandunia, but in English 'I' changes to 'me'.

**salam ti!** Hello you!

Note:  **Ti** means one single person only. The plural pronoun is **timen**, "you all".

**mi salam timen.** I greet you all.

**salam timen!** Hello you all!



### e <small>to be</small>

**mi e tomas.** I am Thomas.

**ti e sara.** You are Sara.

**mau e hewan.** The cat is an animal.

Note: Like every word in Pandunia, **e** is unchanging. So _am, is, are, was_ and _were_ are all translated **e** in Pandunia! In addition, in simple phrases it's allowed to leave out **e** after a pronoun like **mi** and **ti**.

**mi sara.** I'm Sara.

**ti tomas.** You're Thomas.



### ta <small>he, she or it</small>

**ta e fem.** She is a woman.

**ta e man.** He is a man.

**ta e pingo.** It is an apple.

Tip: **Ta** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as things. As you can guess, **Tamen** means "they".

**tamen e pingo.** They are apples.

**mimen salam tamen.** We greet them.

**mimen salam timen.** We greet you.



### ke? <small>what? who?</small>

**ke?** What?

**ti e ke?** Who are you?
**mi e tomas.** I'm Thomas.

**ta e ke?** Who is he/she?
**ta e sara.** She is Sara.

**timen e ke?** Who are you people?

**tamen e ke?** Who are they?



### sa <small>this, that</small>

**sa e ke? / ke e sa?** What's this?

**sa e pingo.** This is an apple.

**sa e roxu pingo.** This is a red apple.

**sa pingo roxu.** This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **roxu**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.



### nam <small>be called, name</small>

**ti nam ke?** What's your name?

**mi nam tomas.** My name is Thomas.

**ta nam ke?** What's his/her name?

**ta nam sara.** Her name is Sara.



### kia <small>to ask a question</small>

**kia ti e tomas?** Are you Thomas?

**kia ti e doktor?** Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **kia**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **mi kia ti doktor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**kia ti bon?** How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)
**mi bon.** I'm good.
**ti ne?** And you?
**mi no bon.** I'm not good.

**ye. mi bon.** Yes, I'm well.

**kia ha doktor?** Is there a doctor?
**ye. ta e doktor.** Yes. He/she is a doctor.

**kia ha vin?** Do you have wine?
**ye. bai i roxu.** Yes, white and red.



### no <small>no, not</small>

### jan <small>to know</small>

**mi jan ta.** I know him/her.

**kia ti jan sa ren?** Do you know that person?

**kia timen jan alise?** Do you know each other?

**mimen jan alise ze long.** We know each other for long.



### ge <small>'s</small>

## Part 2: Eating


### yem <small>consume, eat, drink</small>

**kia ti vole yem koi?** Would you like to eat something?

**ta yem pingo.** He/she eats an apple.

**tamen yem pingo.** They eat apples.

Note: Unlike English, Pandunia doesn't have separate singular and plural forms. Therefore a word like **pingo** can refer to one or more apples.

**kia ti yem kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**mi yem kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **yem** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy!

**mi yem kafe i pan.** I'm having coffee and bread.



### vole <small>want</small>

**ti vole yem ke?** What would you like to eat?

Tip: While English puts the "what" at the beginning of a question, in Pandunia the word order is not affected by the **ke**.

**mi vole yem kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia ti vole yem ca?** Would you like to drink tea?
**no. mi no vole ca. mi vole kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.

**ti vole ke pingo?** Which apple do you want?
**sa roxu.** This red one.



### cing <small>request, please</small>

**mi cing ti yem ca.** I ask you to drink tea.

**mi cing ti lai jia.** I ask you to come home.

**mi cing ti mede mi.** I ask you to help me.

Tip: To make direct requests, drop all the pronouns.

Grammar
-------

This part is for those who want to understand the mechanics of the language. It's not mandatory to read it. You can learn Pandunia perfectly well by studying example sentences and words. Remember, a language is learned _for real_ by using it, not by learning a set of rules!

Pandunia is an analytic language. It means that its grammar is all about the word order (i.e. the syntax). It doesn't deal with words because all words are separate, unchanging and uninflected. The role of a word is decided by its place in a sentence, not by its form or ending!

Basically the grammar of Pandunia consists of sentence templates. The fundamental ones are listed below.

PP : personal pronoun
NP : noun phrase
TAM : tense, aspect or mood particle

1. Noun phrase (NP) types
    1. noun
        - **hua** flower
    2. adjective + noun
        - **roxu hua** red flower
    3. noun + noun : compound word
        - **ca kopa** tea cup
    4. noun + verb : compound word (where the verb functions as a noun)
        - **suba yem** morning meal (morning eating)
    5. verb + noun : compound word
        - **yem ci** : eater (eating doer)
    6. verb + verb
        - **baxa loji** communication study
    7. number + adjective + noun
        - **du roxu hua** two red flowers
2. Predicate phrase types
    1. PP + NP : predicate of identity
        - **me man.** - I'm a man.
        - **ta sara.** - She is Sara.
    2. NP + TAM + NP : predicate of identity
        - **sa fem ye sara.** That woman is Sara.
    3. NP + (TAM) + adjective : predicate of state
        - **hua roxu.** Flower is red.
        - **sa hua gon roxu.** That flower was red.
    4. PP + verb + NP : active predicate
        - **me vide un roxu hua.** I see a red flower.
    5. NP + TAM + verb + NP : active predicate
        - **sara ye vide le roxu hua.** Sara sees the red flower.
        - **tim no vide ta.** Tim doesn't see it.
    6. PP + verb + PP + verb + NP : the pivot structure
        - **me vole ti lai jia.** I want you to come home.
    7. verb + PP + verb + NP : template for questions and other modalities
        - **kia ti lai jia gon?** Did you come home already?
    8. verb + verb + NP : template for requests and commands
        - **cing lai jia.** Please come home.
        - **bana lai jia!** Don't come home!
