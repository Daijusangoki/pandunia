(*) **n** is pronounced with the tip of the tongue except in combinations **nk** and **ng**, where it is velar /ŋ/ like in _banker_ and _finger_. In the end of a word, the **g** in **ng** can be mute. So the word **pang** can be pronounced /paŋ/ or /paŋg/.


### Stress Accent

The stress is on the last syllable of a word.


### Schwa

Schwa is a short, unstressed and neutral vowel, which can be added after a consonant to make pronunciation easier in spoken language. It is never written in Pandunia. However, the symbol /ə/ is used for the schwa in the International Phonetic Alphabet.

For example, some people can ease the pronunciation of words like **sam**, **kop** and **sabab**, which end in consonants, by adding a schwa sound in the end like this /samə/, /kopə/, /sababə/. If words like that are difficult to you, it's better to add a schwa than to "swallow" the last consonant.

The schwa is always unstressed and it doesn't ever change the accented syllable.


## Letter Case

Pandunia is normally written only in small letters (i.e. lower case letters). Larger capital letters are not used and there are no capitalization rules. So it is correct to begin all words with a small letter, including personal names and place names.

There are three reasons why Pandunia doesn't use capital letters.

1. Writing represents speech and there are no "capital sounds" in speech in beginning of proper names etc.
2. Most of the scripts and alphabets of the world have only one letter case.
3. It is simpler to use only small letters.

Note! It's not a big mistake to use capital letters. Sometimes people do it habitually because they are used to them in other languages. Still capital letters are unnecessary and not recommended.

Capital letters are used in standard international acronyms. For example: 10 Mb (des mega bit), 100 Gb (hon giga bit), 2 mm (du mili metre), 200 kJ (du hon kilo jul).


## Syllabification

[-] Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen. The hyphen is placed between spoken syllables. For example: nov, ka-fe, ma-xim, pos-ta.


## Punctuation

[.] All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

[?] Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

[!] Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

[...] Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) may be used to indicate incomplete sentence or uncertainty.

[:] Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation or a list.

[,] Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

In informal texts smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used to indicate mood. For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

**mi vide ti :)** = I see you.  
**mi no vide ti :(** = I don't see you.
