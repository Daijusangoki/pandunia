Spelling of Pandunia
====================

## Alphabet


The Basic Latin alphabet is used for writing Pandunia. Here is the alphabet of Pandunia followed by the symbols of the Internation Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

    Pandunia: A B C  D E F G H I J  K L M N O P R S T U W X Y Z
    IPA:     [a b tʃ d e f g h i dʒ k l m n o p r s t u w ʃ j z]

Pandunia, like Spanish, is pronounced exactly as it is spelt. No letter is silent. Every letter has one sound, always the same.


Vowel Sounds
------------

Pandunia has five vowels.

    I   U
    E   O
      A

They are pronounced as follows: A like in _palm_, E like in _hey_, I like in _machine_, O like in _boy_ and U like in _rude_. They are pure vowels, so their quality doesn't change over the duration of the vowel.

Semivowels Y and W are pronounced like in English.


Consonant Sounds
----------------

    P  B  F     M  W
    T  D  S  Z  N  L  R
    C  J  X        Y
    K  G  H

Most consonants are pronounced same as in English. So the pronunciation of B, D, F, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, T, W and Z is familiar and easy.

The following consonants are pronounced differently in Pandunia than in English.

- G is always hard like in _girl, get_.
- R is preferably trilled like in Scottish English or Spanish _carro_. Also other pronunciations are acceptable. Note that R is never silent!
- S is always voiceless like in _sissy_. Z is voiced like in _zoo_.
- X is always pronounced like SH in _ship_.
- C is pronounced like CH in _chip_.
- J is pronounced like the English J.
- N is pronounced with the tip of the tongue except in combinations NK and NG, where it is velar /ŋ/ like in _banker_ and _finger_. In the end of a word, the G in NG can be silent. So the word PANG can be pronounced /paŋ/ as well as /paŋg/.



## Stress Accent

The stress is on the syllable, which is before the last consonant.

1. Words with only one syllable carry the stress. Ex. MÁU, CÍNG.
2. The stress is on the last syllable in words that end with a consonant. Ex. KOMÚN, BAZÁR, KAMÍS.
3. The stress is on the second last syllable in words that end with a vowel. Ex. DÚNIA, MELÓDI

DÚNIA SÍ MIMEN DI SUNDÁR PLANÉT.  
MÍ WÓL LÓGA KOMÚN BÁXA YÁNI PANDÚNIA.



## Only Large Letters

Pandunia is normally written only in large letters (i.e. capital letters). Small letters are not used at all.

There are many reasons why only capital letters should be used.

1. Writing represents speech. Speech doesn't have large and small sounds.
2. No extra symbols.
    - Exactly 24 symbols are needed to write the 24 speech sounds of Pandunia.
    - Using also small letters would add extra symbols that would look different compared to the corresponding large letters. For example **A** and **a** look like different symbols.
3. Capitalization rules are confusing for many people in the international context.
    - Many writing systems don't have separate large and small symbols, for example Arabic, Devanagari of India, Ge'ez of Ethiopia, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese syllabaries.
    - Capitalization is a late development even in Latin, Greek and Cyrillic alphabets.
4. It is simpler to use only large letters. Complex capitalization rules are avoided. (Besides, capitalization rules vary by language.)
5. Text in large letters is as easy and as fast to read as mixed letters.
    - "This is entirely a practice effect. ... When readers are forced to read large quantities of uppercase text, their reading speed will eventually increase to the rate of lowercase text." [Source](https://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/WordRecognition.aspx)
6. Text in large letters is easier to read for people who have bad eyesight. [Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2016788/)

Note! It's not a big mistake to use small letters. Sometimes people do it habitually because they are used to them in other languages. But the rule is that Pandunia should be written in large letters.

Small letters are used in standard international acronyms. For example: 10 Mb (DES MEGA BIT), 100 Gb (HON GIGA BIT), 2 mm (DU MILI METRE), 1 kJ (UN KILO JUL).


## Syllabification

[-] Words may be divided into syllables with a hyphen. The hyphen is placed between spoken syllables. For example: BIN, KA-FE, YU-MOR, POS-TA.


## Punctuation

[.] All kinds of sentences may end with a full stop.

[?] Questions may end alternatively with a question mark.

[!] Exclamation mark indicates loudness or emphasis.

[...] Three dots (i.e. ellipsis) may be used to indicate incomplete sentence or uncertainty.

[:] Colon indicates the beginning of an explanation or a list.

[,] Comma indicates a small pause or separation between clauses or listed items.

In informal texts smileys, emoticons and emojis may be used to indicate mood. For example **:)** indicates happiness and **:(** indicates sadness.

> MI WIDE TU :) = I see you.  
> MI NO WIDE TU :( = I don't see you.
