## What's Pandunia?

Pandunia is a constructed global interlanguage. In other words, it is a man-made language that is designed to serve in international communication everywhere in the world as a supplement to other languages.

Some remarkable features of Pandunia:

- Pandunia is simpler and easier than naturally evolved international languages like English, Chinese, French and Arabic.
- As a constructed language, Pandunia is completely regular â€“ there are no exceptions.
- Pandunia is truly international! Words of Pandunia are world words, which are borrowed from many languages all across the globe, including the top-10 most widely spoken languages of the world.

## Should I learn it now?

Maybe! Pandunia is still under construction. The grammar is stable but some words can still be changed. If you like to learn constructed languages and help to improve them, you should learn Pandunia and help us! But if you want to learn a complete language that is ready now, probably you should consider learning some other language like Esperanto or Lidepla. Remember, you can always come back to Pandunia later!
