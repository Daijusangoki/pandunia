# Pandunia word by word

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**suba salam!** Good morning!

**den salam!** Good day!

**xam salam!** Good evening!

**noce salam!** Good night!

**kane salam!** Bon appetit!

**lay salam!** Welcome!

**ende salam!** Goodbye!

**safar salam!** Have a safe journey!

**son salam!** Sleep well!

Tip: As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!

Note: **Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and non-religious people in many different countries around the world.



### mi <small>I, me</small>

**mi salama mama.** I greet mother.

**mi salama papa.** I greet father.

**salam mama!** Hello, mother!

**salam papa!** Hello, father!

**mimen salama mama.** We greet mother.



### tu <small>you</small>

**mi salama tu.** I greet you.

**tu salama mi.** You greet me.

Tip: The basic word order is subject-verb-object. Words don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **mi** stays the same in Pandunia, but in English 'I' changes to 'me'.

**salam tu!** Hello you!

Note:  **tu** means one single person only. The plural pronoun is **tumen**, "you all".

**mi salama tumen.** I greet you all.

**salam tumen!** Hello you all!



### si <small>to be</small>

**mi si tomas.** I am Thomas.

**tu si sara.** You are Sara.

**mau si hewan.** The cat is an animal.

Note: Like every word in Pandunia, **si** is unchanging. So _am, is, are, was_ and _were_ are all translated **si** in Pandunia! In addition, in simple phrases it's allowed to leave out **si** after a pronoun like **mi** and **tu**.

**mi sara.** I'm Sara.

**tu tomas.** You're Thomas.



### ye <small>he, she or it</small>

**ye si fem.** She is a woman.

**ye si man.** He is a man.

**ye si pingo.** It is an apple.

Tip: **ye** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as things. As you can guess, **yemen** means "they".

**yemen si pingo.** They are apples.

**mimen salama yemen.** We greet them.

**mimen salama tumen.** We greet you.



### ke? <small>what? who?</small>

**ke?** What?

**tu si ke?** Who are you?  
**mi si tomas.** I'm Thomas.

**ye si ke?** Who is he/she?  
**ye si sara.** She is Sara.

**tumen si ke?** Who are you people?

**yemen si ke?** Who are they?



### sa <small>this, that</small>

**sa si ke? / ke si sa?** What's this?

**sa si pingo.** This is an apple.

**sa si ros pingo.** This is a red apple.

**sa pingo ros.** This apple is red.

Note: When an adjective, like **ros**, is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.

**ye ros.** It's red.


### nam <small>name</small>

**tu nam si ke?** What's your name?

**mi nam si tomas.** My name is Thomas.

**ye nam si ke?** What's his/her name?

### kia <small>to ask a question</small>

**kia tu si tomas?** Are you Thomas?

**kia tu si doktor?** Are you a doctor?

Tip: Yes/no questions frequently begin with **kia**. It is just a regular verb, not a special _question tag_. In fact, the previous question is simply abbreviated from **mi kia tu doktor.** (I ask, you doctor?) by dropping out the first word.

**kia tu bon?** How are you? (Literally: _Are you good?_)  
**mi bon.** I'm good.

**kia tu kana kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**mi kana kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **kana** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy! Usually the object of the verb tells is it about eating, drinking or both.

**mi kana kafe i pan.** I'm having coffee and bread.



### wol <small>want</small>

**kia tu wol kana?** Would you like to eat?

**tu wol kana ke?** What would you like to eat?

Tip: While English puts the "what" at the beginning of a question, in Pandunia the word order is not affected by the **ke**.

**mi wol kana kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia tu wol kana ca?** Would you like to drink tea?  
**no. mi no wol ca. mi wol kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.
