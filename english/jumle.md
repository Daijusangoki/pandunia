# Pandunia word by word

### Introduction

Pandunia is a constructed language that is designed to be relatively easy for everyone. You can learn it fast with this practical course.

The course consists of short lessons. Each lesson introduces one new word, which is used in several different phrases in the lesson. This is to teach you how the word works as part of sentences. Possibly you will encounter also other new words in the same lesson but don't worry about them! You don't have to learn all of them at once. Just memorize the phrases that are useful for you! Maybe the rest will go to your memory subconciously.

You can study this course together with one or several friends. Read the phrases together and try to make small conversations. You can also study alone. Even then it's useful to read out loud and create conversations. Repeat the same phrases several times today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow and so on. As they say, _repetition is the mother of learning_.

Note! Many lessons include also tips and notes like this. They are there to clarify grammatical details for those who are interested. You can skip over them if they are not helpful. You don't have to know the theory of the language. You can just speak Pandunia!




Part 1: Greeting and basics
---------------------------

### salam <small>greet, greeting</small>

**salam** Hello!

**suba salam!** Good morning!

**den salam!** Good day!

**xam salam!** Good evening!

**noce salam!** Good night!

**yem salam!** Bon appetit!

**lai salam!** Welcome!

**go salam!** Goodbye!

**safar salam!** Have a safe journey!

**son salam!** Sleep well!

Tip: As you can see from the range of expressions, **salam** is a general word for well-wishing. Use it any time!

Note: **Salam** is a popular greeting that is used by both religious and non-religious people in many different countries around the world.



### me <small>I, me</small>

**me salam ma.** I greet mother.

**me salam pa.** I greet father.

**salam ma!** Hello, mother!

**salam pa!** Hello, father!

Tip: Repeated word expresses more than one. So the plural of **me** (I) is **meme** (we).

**meme salam ma.** We greet mother.



### ni <small>you</small>

**me salam ni.** I greet you.

**ni salam me.** You greet me.

Tip: The basic word order is subject-verb-object. Words don't ever change their form in Pandunia. That's why **me** stays the same in Pandunia, but in English 'I' changes to 'me'.

**salam ni!** Hello you!

Note:  **ni** means one person only. When there is more than one, say **nini** (_you all_).

**me salam nini.** I greet you all.

**salam nini!** Hello you all!



### ta <small>he, she or it</small>

**ta fem.** She is a woman.

**ta man.** He is a man.

**ta apel.** It is an apple.

Tip: **ta** is the general third person pronoun. It is used for people (irrespective of gender) as well as things. As you can guess, **tata** means "they".

**tata apel.** They are apples.

**meme salam tata.** We greet them.

**meme salam nini.** We greet you.



### e <small>to be</small>

**apel e pal.** The apple is a fruit.

**mau e hewan.** The cat is an animal.

Note: Like every word in Pandunia, **e** is unchanging. So _am, is, are, was_ and _were_ are all translated **e** in Pandunia!

**me e tomas.** I am Thomas.

**ni e sara.** You are Sara.

Tip: In simple phrases it's allowed to leave out **e** after a pronoun like **me** and **ni**.

**me sara.** I'm Sara.

**ni tomas.** You're Thomas.



### no <small>no, not</small>

**mau no e pal.** The cat is not a fruit.

**apel no e hewan.** The apple is not an animal.

**me no e tomas.** I'm not Thomas.

**kia ni yem kafe?** Do you drink coffee?

**me yem kafe.** I drink coffee.

Tip: Meaning of **yem** covers both eating and drinking. It can feel odd at first but soon you will see that it is quite handy! Usually the object of the verb tells is it about eating, drinking or both.

### wol <small>want</small>

**kia ni wol yem?** Would you like to eat?

**me wol yem kafe.** I want to drink coffee.

**kia ni wol yem ca?** Would you like to drink tea?  
**no. me no wol ca. me wol kafe.** No, I don't want tea. I want coffee.
