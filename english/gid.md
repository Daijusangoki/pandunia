# Simple Guide to Pandunia

## Introduction

This is a short and simple guide to Pandunia. This guide explains in short the structure of Pandunia and how does it compare to other languages. The purpose of this guide is to convince you that Pandunia is an interesting language that is worth learning.

All language teachers know that a language becomes more difficult to learn when the student must learn to make distinctions that he is not used to making. That's why students have difficulties with things like irregular spelling, case-inflection, mandatory tenses, tones, noun/adjective agreement, honorific inflection, consonant and vowel harmony, mandatory gender distinctions and so on.

Pandunia is not a difficult language to learn. It doesn't have any of the previously mentioned complexities. Instead, it has a simple grammar, a relatively simple vocabulary, and a simple phonetic spelling.

One thing to keep in mind as you learn Pandunia is that it is not a strict, rule-oriented language where there is a "right way" and a "wrong way" to say things. The important thing is to make yourself understood. Consequently, much of the language involves the lexical items (words that have meaning, like "book" or "eat"), and very little involves purely grammatical ideas (like singular vs. plural and tenses).



## Pronunciation

Pandunia is meant for speakers of different languages so it must be easy to pronounce. The sounds that are used are common across languages.

The vowels are _pure_ like in Spanish.  
**a** (ah), **e** (eh), **i** (ee), **o** (aw), **u** (ooh)

Consonants  
**p** (pen), **b** (bet), **m** (man), **k** (kangaroo), **g** (go), **q** (ng in long), **t** (ten), **d** (den), **n** (not), **c** (cheat), **j** (jet), **s** (sit), **z** (zoo), **x** (ship), **f** (food), **h** (hot), **l** (lip), **r** (red), **w** (wet), **y** (yet).

Most of these are pronounced as in English. The most notable exceptions are **c**, **x** and **q**. Memorize them with this sentence: **ciq xin me.** (It's pronounced roughly _cheeng shin meh_ and it means "Please believe me!")



## Simple Sentences

Sentences in Pandunia are basically built like English sentences. In other words, there is a subject, a verb, and an object.

**me yem pal.** - I ate the fruit. (or) I eat fruit.

There are three interesting things to note here for an English speaker. 

1. There is no conjugation of verbs i.e. there is no tense. **yem** can mean "will eat", "eats" and "ate".
2. There is no distinction between singular and plural nouns. So **pal** can be either "a fruit" or "more than one fruit".
3. There are no articles like "the" and "a" in English. In this detail Pandunia resembles languages like Russian, Chinese and Hindi, which also don't have articles.

Another thing to note here is that the _word classes_ or _parts of speech_ are not as strict in Pandunia as they are in English and most natural languages. The word **yem** can mean both eating and food. (Likewise in French "manger" means both "to eat" and "food", for example.) So **me yem yem.** means "I eat food." Likewise **me gan gan.** means "I sing a song."



## One Word = One Concept

Words of Pandunia are simple. They indicate one thing, act or quality and nothing else.

One example of this is the number in nouns. As we noticed before, **pal** can mean both "a fruit" and "more than one fruit". The number is not part of the noun. Instead we use a number word or a word such as "some" or "many" with the noun.

**pal** - fruit, a fruit, fruits  
**un pal** - one fruit  
**du pal** - two fruits  
**xau pal** - some fruits  
**cok pal** - many fruits

You can also simply say the word twice to indicate that there is more than one.  
**pal pal** - fruits

Pandunia is not the first language to work like this. Similar ways are used in many other languages such as Turkish, Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian and Yoruba. Think how hard it would be for speakers of those languages to learn to use the many types of English plurals correctly, such as _man–men, mouse–mice, sheep–sheep, dog–dogs, alga–algae, phenomenon–phenomena_.



## Easy pronouns

The basic personal pronouns are:  
**me** : I, me  
**ni** : you  
**ta** : he/she/it

There is just one word for he, she and it. It may seem weird for an English speaker, but in fact most languages, including Japanese, Chinese and Persian, have just one word for it.

The plural forms are created by repeating the word.

**meme** : we  
**nini** : you all  
**tata** : they

There is also a way to distinguish different types of "us".  
**nime** : us with you (me and you)  
**tame** : us without you (me and them)



## To Be

The word for "to be" is **e**. It is the shortest verb in Pandunia.

Pandunia is free from conjugation. So there is just one form (**e**) in Pandunia that covers all the forms (be, am, is, are, was, were) in English.

The person is indicated by the subject.

**me e ban.** - I am a friend.  
**ni e ban.** - You are a friend.

The number (singular and plural) is indicated by the subject.

**ta e ban.** - He/she is a friend.  
**tata e ban.** - They are friends.

The verb is denied simply by putting **no** before it.

**ta no e ban.** - He/she is not a friend.  
**tata no e ban.** - They are not friends.

Note: In simple and short sentences it is acceptable to leave out **e** altogether.  
**ta ban.** - He/she, a friend.  
**ta no ban.** - He/she, not a friend.



## Unchanging Verbs

Verbs don't change in Pandunia. The same word is used in the past, the present and the future tenses.

**yer den me go restoran i yem bon yem.**

This sentence can be translated in two ways into English. Firstly you can use the past tense: "Yesterday I went to a restaurant and ate a good meal." Secondly you can use the _historical present_ tense: "Yesterday I go to a restaurant and eat a good meal." The latter may be bad style in English – but the meaning is clear!

It's not necessary to mark verbs for tense and many languages don't do it. It's enough to use a time word, like yesterday, today, tomorrow, now and later, but you don't have to use these words with all the verbs all the time. You use them only when you want to indicate the time.

Here are some useful time words:  
**yer** - last, previous  
**jin** - current, present  
**nex** - next  
**yer den** - yesterday  
**jin den** - today  
**nex den** - tomorrow  



## Prepositions

Pandunia has only four prepositions. All of them have a wide meaning.

**na** : with, at, by, in, on, while  
**be** : without, out, away  
**ze** : from, since, because of  
**do** : to, toward, until, for  

The prepositions can function as verbs by themselves.

**me na dom.** - I'm at/in/on/by the house.  
**me do dom.** - I go to/toward the house.  
**me ze dom.** - I come from the house.  
**me be dom.** - I'm away from the house.

But usually you use them to add more information to a sentence that already has another verb.

**me yem sup | na camca | na ma i pa | na yem kamar.**  
I eat soup | with a spoon | with mom and dad | in the dining-room.

Note: Exact meaning of the preposition depends on the object of the preposition. Therefore **na** is translated with a different word in phrases like **na camca** (with a spoon) and **na kamar** (in the room).




You don't need prepositions if you speak in short sentences and use a suitable verb.

**ta kat piza. ta yoq caku.** - He cuts the pizza. He uses a knife.

You don't need to repeat the subject if you pause. 

**ta kat piza, yoq caku.** - He cuts the pizza, using a knife.



, but when precision is needed, you can use a number of verbs to indicate the role of the phrase in the sentence.
