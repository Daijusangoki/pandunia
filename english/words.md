International words
-------------------

There are several stocks of international words.

Hartmut Traunmuller divided the world into four major cultural spheres in his article [A Universal Interlanguage: Some Basic Considerations](http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/UIL.pdf). The languages within a certain cultural sphere share words (loan words and translated loan words) and cultural concepts. The four major cultural spheres are:

1. The European (Western) cultural sphere
2. The Afro-Asian (Islamic) cultural sphere
3. The South Asian (Indian) cultural sphere
4. The East Asian (Chinese) cultural sphere

They are roughly outlined in the picture below.

How words are selected to Pandunia
----------------------------------

Pandunia's words come from some of the most widely spoken languages of the world. There is a methodology for selecting words. The three key criteria for selecting words are:

- **Equality** : Words are be borrowed equally from different regions of the world. In practice it means that Pandunia has words from the languages of Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa.
- **Prevalence** : Widely spread words are favored. The more people know the word the better.
- **Simplicity** : Word forms with easy pronunciation are favored.
