International words
-------------------

There are several stocks of international words.

Hartmut Traunmuller divided the world into four major cultural spheres in his article [A Universal Interlanguage: Some Basic Considerations](http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/UIL.pdf). The languages within a certain cultural sphere share words (loan words and translated loan words) and cultural concepts. The four major cultural spheres are:

1. The European (Western) cultural sphere
2. The Afro-Asian (Islamic) cultural sphere
3. The South Asian (Indian) cultural sphere
4. The East Asian (Chinese) cultural sphere

They are roughly outlined in the picture below.

How words are selected to Pandunia
----------------------------------

Pandunia's words come from some of the most widely spoken languages of the world. There is a methodology for selecting words. The three key criteria for selecting words are:

- **Equality** : Words are be borrowed equally from different regions of the world. In practice it means that Pandunia has words from the languages of Europe, the Americas, Asia and Africa.
- **Prevalence** : Widely spread words are favored. The more people know the word the better.
- **Simplicity** : Word forms with easy pronunciation are favored.




Word Building
-------------

It's possible to build new words in Pandunia. It is said that Pandunia has a productive system of word derivation. Pandunia uses suffixes, which are already in international use. Many of them come from ancient Greek and Latin and Arabic.

### -i

**-i** is the most common and the most general adjectival suffix. It can mean different things depending on the base word.

- That which is: **kitabi** written; **logi** spoken
- That which is like: **manuxi** human; **metali** metallic
- That which belongs to: **iraki** Iraqi, of Iraq

This suffix is influenced by several languages. In Arabic, Persian, Urdu and Hindi -ī is a very common suffix for deriving adjectives from nouns. English has similar sounding adjectival suffix -y. Also in Japanese -i is a frequent adjectival suffix.


### -al

**-al** is originally a common adjectival suffix in Western words. It describes something that is somehow related. For example **socia** society → **social** social, related to society.


### -er

Maker, agent of action. Ekz. **beker** baker, **lider** leader, **xofer** driver.

**-er** is the agentive suffix in English and German. It has equivalents in the Romance languages, such as French -eur, Spanish -ero and Portuguese -eiro. The suffix is found in many French and English loan words in Russian, such as шофёр /šofyor/ (chauffeur) and лидер /lidyer/ (leader).


### -or

**-or** is a technical suffix that is used for mechanical equipment and machinery. For example **motor, filtor** (filter), **komputor** (computer).


### -ia

Names of places, regions and lands often end in **-ia**.

- Lands: **arabia** Arabia, **indonesia** Indonesia, **rusia** Russia, **turkia** Turkey
- Regions: **imperia** empire, **nasia** nation, **demokratia** democracy, **media** middle area, **tabia** nature
- Shops and workshops: **bekeria** bakery.

**-ia** is a very common and wide-spread suffix. It's used in many languages in names of countries and regions. Pandunia adopts this practice.

| Pandunia | English | Italian | Russian          | Turkish | Arabic        |
|----------|---------|---------|------------------|---------|---------------|
| asia     | Asia    | Asia    | Азия (Aziya)     | Asya    | آسِيَا (āsiyā)   |
| italia   | Italy   | Italia  | Италия (Italiya) | İtalya  | إِيطَالِيَا (ītāliyā) |
| rusia    | Russia  | Russia  | Россия (Rossiya) | Rusya   | رُوسِيَا (rūsiyā) |
| suria    | Syria   | Siria   | Сирия (Siriya)   | Suriye  | سُورِيَا (sūriyā) |
| turkia   | Turkey  | Turchia | Турция (Turciya) | Türkiye | تُرْكِيَّا (turkiyā) |

By coincidence, Japanese has a similar sounding suffix for words for places. For example
パン (_pan_ = bread) → パン屋 (_pan'ya_ = bakery, "bread shop").


### -ian

The suffix **-ian** is derived from **-ia** and it means something or someone that belongs to or comes from that place. For example: **asian, italian, rusian**. There are a few words where **-an** means the same thing: **afrikan, amerikan, europan**.


### -ie

**-ie** is the ending for abstract things and systems, such as science and religion. Although not as common as **-ia**, there are enough models in natural languages (including French and German) to establish this pattern.
