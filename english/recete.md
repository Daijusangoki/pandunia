## The Big Picture
 
## Introduction

In this article we introduce the five control languages of Pandunia and how they decide the grammar and vocabulary of Pandunia.


## The Control Languages

The structure and vocabulary of Pandunia is based largely on five control languages. The control languages are the five most widely spoken languages of the world, as follows.

1. English
2. Standard Chinese (from now on: _Chinese_)
3. Spanish
4. Hindustani (including Hindi and Urdu)
5. Modern Standard Arabic (from now on: _Arabic_)

Native and non-native speakers of these languages comprise more than half of the world population and they live on all continents and major population centers of the world.


### World heritage

English and Spanish carry the heritage of Latin and Greek, which have greatly influenced all languages of Europe, America and beyond, including French, Portuguese, Italian, German, Polish and Russian.

Chinese carries the Sinitic heritage, which has deeply influenced also all other languages of East Asia, including Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese.

Hindustani carries the heritage of Sanskrit, which has influenced also all other languages of South and South-East Asia, including Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Burmese, Thai, Malay and Indonesian.

Arabic and Hindustani carry the Perso-Arabic heritage, which has greatly influenced languages of Central, South-West, South and South-East Asia and North, West and East Africa, including Turkish, Persian, Bengali, Punjabi, Telugu, Indonesian, Hausa, Wolof, Amharic, Oromo, Somali and Swahili.



## Grammar

### Inflection system

Chinese has no inflection. Words are only combined to larger words. Some words have a special meaning when they appear as a part of a larger word. (These are called [bound morphemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bound_and_unbound_morphemes)).

English, Spanish and Hindustani use mainly _root and affix system_. The meaning is changed by adding dependent parts before and after the root. For example "booklets" consists of root _book_ and affixes _-let_ (which adds meaning of smallness) and _-s_ (which adds plural meaning). Most affixes can't appear alone, but they need a root.

Arabic uses [root and pattern system](https://www.britannica.com/topic/root-and-pattern-system). The root consists of (usually three) consonants and the root is inflected by inserting a pattern of vowels between them. Arabic also has affixes for creating additional words from root and pattern.

Pandunia uses _root and affix system_. The principles of this system are known to most people. New words can be created easily.


### Parts of speech

There is no systematic marking for parts of speech in any of the control languages.



### Sentence Word order

In English, Chinese, Spanish and Arabic the order of sentence constituents is subject–verb–object. In Hindustani it is subject–object–verb.

The normal word order in Pandunia is subject–verb–object.


- Modifier comes before the modified as in English, Chinese and Hindustani.
    - Numeral is before the head.
    - Adjective is before the head.


Alone a content word refers to the idea in general.


### Syllable patterns

Often it is said that Spanish has simple syllable patterns. However there are also more complex ones, like these: us|ted, vo|sot|ros, cris|tal, abs|trac|to, pers|pec|ti|va, trans|for|mar.

Pandunia allows the syllable patterns that are shown in the table below.
V = vowel  
C = consonant  
L = liquid consonant (l, r or y)  
N = nasal  

| Pattern | Examples           |
|---------|--------------------|
| V       | i, u, a, ata       |
| CV      | de, ma, pa, batata |
| CVV     | dia, hua           |
| VC      | el, as             |
| CVC     | man, raq, kup, ted |
| CLVC    | grup, klas, nyam   |
| CVNC    | dant               |
| CLVNC   | kramp              |

Simple patterns are more frequent than complex patterns.
 
## Phonotactics
 
Allowed final consonants
 
| Language   | Nasals | Resonants | Voiceless stops | Voiced stops | Fricatives | Clusters |
|------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Mandarin   | n ng   | r         | -               | -            | -          | none     |
| English    | m n ng | r l       | p t k ch        | b d g j      | s z sh zh  | complex  |
| Spanish    | n      | r l       | -               | d            | s          | none     |
| Hindustani | m n ~  | r l       | p t k c         | b d g j      | s sh       | simple   |
| Arabic     | m n    | r l       | p t k           | b d g        | s z sh     | none     |
| Russian    | m n ñ  | r l       | p t k ch        | -            | s sh x     | complex  |
 
## Morphology
 
 
 
Many languages treat proper nouns in a special way. Names don't have to conform to the morphology of the language.
 
We must assume that the interlanguage has to deal with names in all shapes and sizes, such as Tim, Mei, Maria, Muhamad, Idris and Yuri. Some of them might not conform to the morphology of the interlanguage. For example in Esperanto all nouns end in -o. So what to do with all possible proper nouns? Should names be adapted for the language, or should the language be adapted to accept different kinds of names?
 
It is reasonable to let proper nouns be as they were. Pandunia accepts all names without any changes. (However in practice it is wise to convert them to the Pandunia alphabet.) So there is a large group of nouns that do not conform to any morphological constraints.
 
 
 
ti = this
to = so
si = this, that
so = so
 
This situation is a problem in Esperanto, where all nouns should end in -o. So should all names, such as Tim, Joanne, Lee and Maria, be "localized" to Esperanto?
 
Overlap of word forms can't be avoided.
 
## Transitivity
 
 
## Loan words
 
### Western words
 
Typically Western words have this structure: prefix + root + suffixes. Usually the root ends in a consonant.

For example in Spanish, the root cort- (short) can be combined with affixes to produce different kinds of words.

- Adjectives: corto (masc.), corta (fem.)
- Noun: cortedad
- Verb: acortar

Also English uses comparable affixes.

- Adjectives: short, shorter, shortest
- Nouns: shortness, shorty
- Verb: shorten

Pandunia borrows the roots of Western words. The goal is to select a form that sounds familiar to speakers of as many languages as possible.

| Pandunia root | English    | Portuguese | Spanish    | French     | German     | Russian    |
|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **kort**      | short      | curto      | corto      | court      | kurz       | korotkiy   |
| **now**       | new        | novo       | nuevo      | nouveau    | neu        | novıy      |
| **marc**      | march      | marcha     | marcha     | marche     | Marsch     | marš       |
| **post**      | post (mail)| (postal)   | posta      | poste      | Post       | počta      |

The suffixes of Pandunia are applied on the roots. Here are some resulting Pandunia words: korti (short), korte (shorty), korta (shorten), nowi (new), nowe (news), nowa (renovate).

### Indian words

### Sinitic words

Sinitic words are words from Middle Chinese that are used today in languages of East Asia, including Chinese languages, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Sinitic words are single-syllable words or compounds of syllabic elements.

Middle Chinese had lexical tone. Today Chinese languages and Vietnamese have tones but they are not the same as in Middle Chinese. Japanese and Korean are not tonal languages so they have ignored the tones. Also Pandunia ignores the tones. (To ignore the tones is about the same as to ignore the stress accent or pitch accent of other source languages.)

Middle Chinese had unreleased stop consonants, which are usually written -p, -t and -k. Cantonese, Vietnamese and Korean keep them mostly as they were. Mandarin has deleted them. Japanese has added a vowel to ease pronunciation. Pandunia keeps the final stops and adds a normal PoS suffix.
 
| 字 | Pandunia root | Cantonese  | Mandarin   | Japanese   | Korean     | Vietnamese |
|----|---------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 水 | **suy**       | sui        | shuǐ       | sui        | su         | thuỷ       |
| 中 | **jung**      | zung       | zhōng      | chū        | jung       | trung      |
| 心 | **xim**       | sam        | xīn        | shin       | sim        | tâm        |
| 門 | **mun**       | mun        | mén        | mon        | mun        | (môn)      |
| 問 | **wen**       | man        | wèn        | mon        | mun        | vấn        |
| 讀 | **dug**       | duk        | dú         | doku       | dog        | đọc        |
| 出 | **cud**       | cœt        | chū        | shutsu     | chul       | xuất       |
| 索 | **sog**       | sok        | suǒ        | saku       | sæg        |            |
| 惡 | **ag**        | ok         | è          | aku        | ag         | ác         |

Applying the suffixes of Pandunia to Sinitic roots may seem unusual at first, but it is nothing new – Sinitic words are already inflected in Korean!
