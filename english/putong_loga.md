## Correlatives

> Correlatives are the words used to ask questions which require specific answers -- the "who, what, when, where, how" of a language, and their general answers ("there, here, everywhere, nowhere, somewhere").  
> -- [Don Harlow](http://literaturo.org/HARLOW-Don/Esperanto/correlatives.html)

In Pandunia the "correlatives" are built from separate words in a logical manner. Each "correlative" consists of a determiner and a noun.

The determiners are independent words. Basically it's an open class of words, so also other words can be used to create new "correlatives". Anyway, the most frequent determiners are listed below.

> **ke** - what? which?  
> **sa** - this, that  
> **yo** - some  
> **mei** - every, each, all  
> **nul** - none  

Basic category nouns are:

> **jen** - person  
> **ce** - thing  
> **yang** - kind, type  
> **lok** - place  
> **sat** - time, moment  

These determiners and category nouns can be combined into this table of correlatives.
