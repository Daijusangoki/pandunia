> If we imagine a fictitious language, in which all kinds of grammatical markings are missing [...] we come to the principles of an isolating language

When talking about grammar, many people first think of marking of person, tense, mood, case, number and gender in words, and usage of articles, prepositions and other so called _grammar words_ and the rules that govern them. For many, they are the natural building blocks of grammar and they can't imagine a language without them. The grammar of Pandunia is different. It doesn't have any grammatical markings and there are very few rules that concern specific words.

Structurally Pandunia is an isolating language. In Pandunia, all words are unchanging – they aren't ever inflected, and there are no endings like the plural -s or -es in English. So instead of the form, it is the _meaning_ of words that matters, and their place in the sentence.

These are the reasons why an isolating structure was chosen for Pandunia, the global contact language:

- Natural isolating languages are not uncommon. They are particularly common in Southeast Asia, Oceania and West Africa.
    - The Chinese languages are isolating. This includes Mandarin Chinese, which is spoken by more native speakers than any other language on earth.
    - Also several other isolating languages are spoken by millions of speakers, such as Vietnamese, Thai, Burmese, Yoruba and Igbo.
- Spontaneously created _contact languages_ tend to be isolating. This applies also to most instances of _pidgin English_.
- It's easier to learn _just words_ than to learn rules and their exceptions.
    - Isolating languages are considered to be generally easier to learn than inflectional and agglutinating languages.
    - Usually learners speak an isolating variant of the target language at first anyway, for example a kind of "broken English".
- The gap between a beginner and a fluent speaker is more narrow and less obvious for an isolating language than for inflectional languages.
- It's easier to borrow words in all shapes and forms when the grammar doesn't set any morphological criteria.

This grammar deals with the types of words and word order patterns in Pandunia. However, it's possible to learn Pandunia without reading this grammar, for example with the help of a phrasebook and a dictionary.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic Rules
-----------

1. Every word is read as it is written. No letter is silent. Only the lower-case letters are necessary.
2. The stress accent is on the syllable before the last consonant of the word.
3. Nouns are unaffected by number or gender. They are neither masculine nor feminine, and neither singular nor plural by default.
4. When an adjective is placed before a noun, it works as a modifier. When it follows the noun, it works as an adjectival verb.
    - ex. **bon pan** = Good bread. **ta bon** = It (is) good.
5. Compound words are made by combining the elements that form them. The main word stands at the end.
    - ex. **poste sanduk** = mailbox
6. Sentences with transitive verbs have subject-verb-object word order.
    - ex. **mi penta meza.** = I paint tables.
7. A sentence with passive meaning has only a subject and a verb.
    - ex. **ta penta.** = It is painted.
8. The subject of a sentence consists of a personal pronoun alone, or a noun phrase followed by a tense, aspect or mood particle.
    - **mimen baxa pandunia.** = We speak Pandunia.
    - **jen ye baxa pandunia.** = People _indeed_ speak Pandunia.
9. The object of a transitive verb can function as the subject of the next verb in the sentence. This structure is called the _pivot structure_.
    - ex. **mi cing ti dar pesa.** = I ask you to give money.
10. Pronouns can be left out when they are obvious and redundant.
    - **mi kia ti baxa pandunia?** → **kia ti baxa pandunia?** = Do you speak Pandunia?
    - **mi cing ti loga tez.** →  **cing loga tez.** = Please speak louder.




Parts of speech
---------------

All words are invariable in Pandunia. There is no inflexion of any kind. That's why the parts of speech depend on the meaning of words, not on the form.

The parts of speech in Pandunia are:

1. The noun names a thing, a person, an abstract concept or a proper name, ex. stone, table, robot, cat, human, city, london.
2. The modifier is a word that adds some quality to the thing denoted by another word, ex. good, bad, big, fast.
3. The numeral is a word that tells the number or amount of things.
4. The verb denotes an action or an occurence, ex. to eat, to speak, to look and to think.
5. The particle is a structural or an abstract word, ex. yes, no, but, if.



Nouns
-----

A noun is a word that names a thing. Like all words in Pandunia, nouns are invariant. So the same form is used in singular and plural, in definite and indefinite, etc.

> **batu** - a stone, stones, the stone or the stones  
> **meza** - a table, tables, the table or the tables  
> **kursi** - a chair, chairs, the chair or the chairs  
> **sui** - water

Quite often number and definiteness is known because it was specified earlier or because it is general knowledge. For example, normally the word **surya** refers to _the sun_ and **luna** refers to _the moon_, our only sun and our only moon.

Two or more nouns can be put together to make a compound word. The last word is the most meaningful word in the compound and the words that come before it only modify the meaning.

> **surya guang** - sun light  
> **luna guang** - moon light  
> **luna batu** - moon stone

An easy way to emphasize plurality is to repeat the noun.

> **batu batu** - stones, lots of stones
> **tara tara** - stars, lots of stars



Modifiers
---------

A modifier is a word that adds a particular quality for another word. In Pandunia modifiers come before the noun that they modify.

> **dai batu** - big stone
> **cung batu** - heavy stone  
> **dai meza** - big table  
> **gau meza** - high table
> **bon kursi.** - good chair

When a modifier follows a noun phrase, it becomes a stative verb.

> **batu dai.** - The stone is big.  
> **meza gau.** - The table is high.

Naturally there can be modifiers on both sides of the noun as well.

> **dai meza gau.** - The big table is high.

Modifiers can modify also verbs. Then they function like English adverbs.

> **mi _bon_ son.** - I sleep _well_.  
> **ti _bon_ baxa pandunia.** - You speak Pandunia _well_.


Numerals
--------

Sometimes it is known from the context how many objects are spoken about. For example, the word **surya** (sun) normally refers to just one sun because there is only one.

Quantity can be expressed with numerals and other quantity-words. They are put before the word or phrase that they qualify.

> **un tara** - one star  
> **du tara** - two stars  
> **sam tara** - three stars  
> **xau tara** - few stars  
> **poli tara** - many stars

> **un dai meza** - one big table  
> **du dai kursi** - two big chairs  
> **sam bon kursi** - three good chairs

Ordinal numbers come after the word that they modify.

> **fen un** - the first part (part one)
> **fen du** - the second part (part two)
> **fen sam** - the third part (part three)

The basic number words are:

- 0 **nul**
- 1 **un**
- 2 **du**
- 3 **sam**
- 4 **car**
- 5 **lim**
- 6 **sis**
- 7 **set**
- 8 **bat**
- 9 **noi**

Greater numbers are simply made by putting one digit after another – exactly like they are written in the universal numerical language of mathematics.

- 10 **un nul** or **des**
- 11 **un un**
- 12 **un du**
- 13 **un sam**
- 20 **du nul**
- 21 **du un**
- 22 **du du**
- 100 **un nul nul** or **hon**
- 101 **un nul un** or **hon un**
- 200 **du nul nul** or **du hon**


Numbers that are greater than 999 may use the multiples from the International System of Units. So for example kilo denotes a multiple of a thousand.

- 1000 **kilo**
- 1 000 000 **mega**
- 1 000 000 000 **giga**
- 1 000 000 000 000 **tera**
- 10<sup>15</sup> **peta**
- 10<sup>18</sup> **eksa**
- 10<sup>21</sup> **zeta**
- 10<sup>24</sup> **yota**
    


Pronouns
--------

### Personal pronouns

Pronouns can substitute thing-words and phrases of thing-words.

**mi** - I, me  
**ti** - you  
**ta** - he, she, it  
**mimen** - we  
**timen** - you all  
**tamen** - they

**se** - self

Note! The reflexive pronoun **se** is used for all persons, so it corresponds to English _myself_, _yourself_, _himself_, _herself_, _itself_, ourselves_ and _themselves_ all at once.

**mi vide se** - I see myself.
**ta vide se** - She sees herself. / He sees himself.
**mimen vide se.** - We see ourselves.


### Demonstrative pronouns

**Sa** is the general demonstrative pronoun. It covers the meaning of both _this_ and _that_.

The distance to the speaker can be specified by adding words **jin** (near) and **far** (far), if needed.

**sa** - this or that
**sa jin** - this over here
**sa far** - that over there

The demonstrative pronouns work like modifiers.

> **sa batu.** - That stone
> **sa e batu.** - That is a stone.
> **sa batu cung.** - That stone is heavy.


### Interrogative pronoun

**Ke** is a general-purpose interrogative pronoun. It does the job of English words _who, what_ and _which_.

> **ke?** - Who or what?
> **ke ting?** - What? (Which thing?)
> **ke jen?** - Who? (Which person?)
> **ke sat?** - When? (What time?)
> **ke yang?** - How? (What manner?)
> **ke koz?** - Why? (What cause?)



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Verbs
------

### Predicate of state

Normally a sentence consists of a subject and a predicate. In the simplest sentences, the subject is a noun or a pronoun and the predicate is an adjective.

**mi bon.** - I am good.  
**sara bon.** - Sara is good.  
**batu cung.** - Stone is heavy.

Likewise, it's possible that the subject is a pronoun and the predicate is a noun.

> **ta sara.** - She is Sara.
> **ta batu.** - It is a stone.

But when two similar words (that belong to the same part of speech) are put together, it is necessary to separate them. Then the verb **e** (to be) is used.

> **ta e mi.** - It is me.
> **sa e batu.** - That is a stone.
> **batu e ting.** - Stone is a thing.
> **jovan e sundar.** - Young is beautiful.

To deny something, use the word **no** before **e**.

> **mi no e ti.** - I'm not you.
> **batu no e hewan.** Stone is not an animal.
> **jovan no e sundar.** - Young is not beautiful.



### Predicate of action

In predicates of action, the main word in the predicate is a verb (i.e. an action-word).

Active sentences are frequently in the subject–verb–object word order (SVO).

> **mi yem pingo.** - I eat apples.  
> **mi audi musik.** - I hear music.  
> **mi vide ti.** - I see you.

There is also alternative word order, subject–object–verb (SOV). It can be used only in short sentences.

**mi pingo yem.** - _I apples eat._

SOV and SVO are the two most common word orders by far in the languages of the world. SOV is used in languages like Hindi-Urdu, Tamil, Turkish, Japanese and Korean. SVO is used in English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, Indonesian and Modern Arabic among others.

In passive sentences, the subject is the undergoer of the action and there is no object.

> **ti vide.** - You are seen.  
> **musik audi.** - Music is heard.

Passive can be expressed with help of the verb **bei**.

> **ti bei vide.** - You get seen.  
> **musik bei audi.** - Music gets heard.



### Serial verbs

All action-words (verbs) that come one after another are activated by the subject. There can be two, three or even more action-words in series.
 
1. **mi go dom.** - I go home.  
2. **mi ken go dom.** - I can go home.  
3. **mi vol ken go dom.** - I want to be able to go home. (Lit. _I want can go home_!)
 

 
### Pivot structure

When the predicate has an object, the object can begin a new predicate. This is called the _pivot structure_.

> **mi vol ti yem sabzi.** - I want (that) you eat vegetables.

In the example above, **mi vol** has **ti** as its object. At the same time, **ti** functions as the subject of the following predicate, **yem sabzi**. So **ti** is the _pivot_ of the sentence.



### Pronoun dropping

In certain types of expressions the pronouns get dropped for brevity. This is done especially in commands and requests.

> **mi cing ti lai.** - I ask you to come.  
> **cing lai!** - Please come! (Literally: _Request come!_)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Particles
---------


### Affirmation and negation

Particle **ye** is affirmative and **no** is negative. **Ye** affirms the existence of something, whereas **no** denies it.

> **mi e jen.** - I am a person.  
> **ta e un nova meza.** - It is a new table.

Such sentences can be simply negated with **no**.

> **mi no e jen.** - I'm not a person.  
> **ta no e nova meza.** - It's not a new table.

The word **no** is used for denying anything. It affects always the next word.

> **mi vide ti.** - I see you.  
> **mi no vide ti.** - I don't see you.  
> **mi vide no ti ama tamen.** - I see, not you, but them.

The particles **ye** and **no** are used for answering questions.

> **kia ti vide mi?** - Do you see me?  
> **ye. (mi vide ti.)** - Yes. (I see you.)  
> **no. (mi no vide ti.)** - No. (I don't see you.)



### Modifier particles

Particles **ge** and **de** are used to mark possession and modification. **Ge** connects the modifying word or phrase to the modified word. **De** works in the opposite direction. It connects the modified word to the modifier.

#### Possession

The modifier particle can be used for any possessive noun or pronoun.

With regards to possession, **ge** works like apostrophe-s ('s) in English.

> **maria ge mama** - Maria's mother  
> **mi ge bet** - my house  
> **mi ge papa ge bet** - my father's house

**De** works like "of" in English.

> **mama de maria** - the mother of Maria
> **bet de mi** - the house of mine  
> **bet de papa de mi** - the house of the father of mine

#### Attribution with adjectives

Another way to use these particles is to connect an adjective or other words with a noun. It gives us more information about the noun, and the particle makes it clear in which end the main noun is.

Normally the adjective is before the noun in Pandunia. It can be placed after the noun with the help of **de**.

> **nova bet** - new house  
> **bet de nova** - house _of new_

The modifier particles are useful for creating complex adjectives that consists of two or more words.

> **roza rang ge lab** - rose-colored lips  
> **sama rang ge mat** - sky-colored eyes

Or in the opposite order:

> **lab de roza rang** - lips of the color of the rose  
> **mat de sama rang** - eyes of the color of the sky

#### Relative clauses

Also relative clauses are created with help of the modifier particles.

Here **de** has a similar role as English relative pronouns _which_, _that_, _who_ and _whom_.

> **ta e man _de mi vide_.** - He is the man _that I saw_.

It's possible to construct relatives clauses with **ge** too. Then the relative clause precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the particle **ge**. This structure doesn't exist in English, so there isn't a word-for-word translation for it.

**ta e _mi vide ge_ man.** - *He is the _my seen_ man.

If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (i.e. if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause.

> **mi vide man _de yem pingo_.** - I see a man _who eats apples_.  
> **mi vide _yem pingo ge_ man.** - I see an _apple-eating_ man.



### Mood Particles

Mood particles indicate what the speaker thinks about s/he says in relation to the listener. Mood particles are commonly used in many languages. East Asian languages, including Chinese and Japanese, use famously sentence-final particles.

In Pandunia, a mood particle modifies the subsequent word, or the whole sentence, when the mood particle is the last word in the sentence.

The particle **plus** _(also)_ is a good example because it functions much like in English.

> **ta yem bir plus.** - S/he drinks beer, _also_.  
> **ta yem plus bir.** - S/he drinks _also beer_.  
> **ta plus yem bir.** - S/he _also drinks_ beer.  
> **plus ta yem bir.** - _Also s/he_ drinks beer.

Note! Also adjectives can modify the subsequent word or the entire sentence.

> **mi bon kitab buk.** - I write well books.
> **mi kitab bon buk.** - I write good books.
> **mi kitab buk bon.** - I write books well.

However, mood particles can modify all kinds of words, including pronouns and numerals, which adjectives can't modify.


### Tense and Aspect Particles

In Pandunia, tense can be expressed with time words and time phrases if needed. The general time words are **gon** (past), **nun** (present) and **futur** (future). They function like adjectives and adverbs, so typically their place is before the verb or at the end of the sentence.

> **mi ha mau gon.** - I had cats in the past.
> **ama mi no ha mau nun.** - But I don't have cats now.
> **munkin mi ha mau futur.** - Maybe I have cats in the future.

Note! Verbs are not conjugated. So the verb **ha** stayed the same in all tenses in the examples above.

Naturally time words are used only when they are necessary. Usually it is enough to mention the time just once at the beginning of the text and not in every single sentence, if the tense doesn't change.


<!-- There are also countless of other ways to express time. -->


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prepositions
------------

### Prepositions of place and time

Pandunia has three prepositions of place and time.

1. **na** - location or moment (in general): at, in, on, during
2. **ze** - origin or beginning: from, since
3. **do** - destination or end: to, till, until

Prepositions are not used as frequently in Pandunia as in English. In many phrases, the verb says enough alone.

> **mi lai dom.** - I come home.  
> **ti sit kursi.** - You sit (on) the chair.  
> **ta lala sofa.** - S/he lies (on) the sofa.  
> **maci nata daria.** - Fish swim (in) the sea.  
> **djang nik marce dau.** - Warriors march (on) the road.  

A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. In a simple prepositional phrase the preposition is complemented by a pronoun or a noun phrase.

> **mi na hotel.** - I'm in the hotel.  
> **mi son na hotel.** - I sleep in the hotel.  
> **mi son ze cam do suba.** - I sleep since evening until morning.  
> **mi safar ze london do paris.** - I travel from London to Paris.  

Prepositions can be complemented also by a verb phrase. Then they refer to time.

> **mi deng ze ti go.** - I have waited since you left.  
> **mi deng do ti lai dom.** - I wait until you come home.  
> **mi deng na ti son.** - I wait while you sleep.  

More precise expressions of place and time are expressed with _a preposition + a place word + **de**_.

> **na dur de** - for the time/duration of  
> **mi deng na dur de ti son.** - I wait for the time when you sleep.  
> **na lok de** - at the place of  
> **mi deng na lok de ti toka.** - I wait at the place where you left.  
> **na xia de** - under, below  
> **un waf lala na xia de meza.** - A dog lies under the table.  
> **na par de** - on the surface of  
> **un mau lala na par de meza.** - A cat lies on the table.

Similar meaning can be expressed also with compound words.

> **un mau lala na meza par.** - A cat lies at the tabletop.

In addition, a preposition can be followed immediately by a verb.

> **dur** - to last, to take time
> **mi deng na dur de ti son.** - _I wait during you sleep._


### Prepositions of manner

Preposition **bi** indicates means. It corresponds to English prepositions _with_ and _by (by means of)_. The meaning of **bi** is very broad. Often it is followed by another word that defines the meaning more precisely.

> **mi kat pan bi kati.** - I cut bread with a knife.  
> **mi kat pan bi yung kati.** - I cut bread by using a knife.

Prepositions **ka** indicates manner or style. It corresponds to English prepositions _like_, _than_, _as_ and _as if_.

> **mi sap pandunia ka guru.** - I know Pandunia like a master.

**Ka** relates the verb or the adjective to a point of comparison. In the above example **loga** (know-how) is the verb and **guru** (master) is the point of comparison.

**Ka** is also used when adjectives are compared.

> **ban e min dai ka papa.** - The child is smaller than the father.  
> **opa e sem dai ka papa.** - Grandfather is as big as father.

**Ka** relates the adverbs of comparison – **max** (more), **min** (less) and **sem** (same) – to the point of comparison, which is **papa** (father) in the examples above.




### List of compound prepositions

**na ante** before. **na bada** after.  
**na cen** in front. **na pice** behind.  
**na xia** under, below. **na gau** over, above.  
**na jin** near. **na long** far away. **na visin** beside, next to.

### Hierarchy of Word Types

Spoken language is a flow of sounds which constitute words. Written language, in the case of Pandunia, is a flow of letters from left to right, which constitute words. So every expression is essentially a sequence of words. However all words are not equal. There is a hierarchy of words. The verb is the structural center of a sentence and other words are directly or indirectly connected to it.

Each sentence can be drawn as a tree diagram, where the central words are above and the dependant words are below. For example the sentence **mi vide ti** (I see you) can be pictured as a tree as follows.

    mi vide ti.

       vide
      ┌─┴─┐
     mi   ti

Adjectives and numerals point to their head word, the noun.

    mi vide sam jovan jen.

       vide
      ┌─┴──┐
     mi   jen
           |
         jovan
           |
          sam

The hierarchy of word types in Pandunia from the more to the less central is as follows.

1. Conjunctions: i, u
2. Connectors: ge, de
3. Coverbs (prepositions): na, do, ze, bi
4. Verbs
5. Nouns and pronouns
6. Tense, aspect and mood particles
7. Numerals
8. Adjectives

The following example shows how the scope affects the final position of words in the tree hierarchy. For example, although **i** is in general higher than **koz**, here its scope is only to connect **yusef** and **sara**. **Ze koz de** is at the top, because it connects the two sub-phrases.


    yusef i sara vol darsa pandunia ze koz de ta e bon dunia baxa.

                      ze koz de
               ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              vol                    e
          ┌────┴──────┐           ┌──┴──┐
          i         darsa        ta    baxa
      ┌───┴───┐    ┌──┴────┐            |
    yusef   sara       pandunia       dunia
                                        |
                                       bon
